If you do meet Horatio andMarcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\nFran.: I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS.\nHor.: Friends to this ground.\nMar.: And liegemen to the Dane.\nFran.: Give you good night.\nMar.: O, farewell, honest soldier: Who hath relieved you?\nFran.: Bernardo has my place. Give you good night.Exit.\nMar.: Holla! Bernardo!\nBer.: Say, What, is Horatio there?\nHor.: A piece of him.\nBer.: Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.\nMar.: What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\nBer.: I have seen nothing.\nMar.: Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us: Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night; That if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes and speak to it.\nHor.: Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.\nBer.: Sit down awhile; And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story What we have two nights seen.\nHor.: Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\nBer.: Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one,Enter Ghost.\nMar.: Peace, break thee off;look, where it comes again!\nBer.: In the same figure, like the king that's dead.\nMar.: Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\nBer.: Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.\nHor.: Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.\nBer.: It would be spoke to.\nMar.: Question it, Horatio.\nHor.: What art thou that usurp'st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!\nMar.: It is offended.\nBer.: See, it stalks away!\nHor.: Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!Exit Ghost.\nMar.: 'Tis gone, and will not answer.\nBer.: How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale: Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on't?\nHor.: Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.\nMar.: Is it not like the king?\nHor.: As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated; So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange.\nMar.: Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\nHor.: In what particular thought to work I know not: But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.\nMar.: Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week; What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Who is't that can inform me?\nHor.: That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet For so this side of our known world esteem'd him Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror: Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant, And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other As it doth well appear unto our state But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost: and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.\nBer.: I think it be no other but e'en so: Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch; so like the king That was and is the question of these wars.\nHor.: A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on. Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen. But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!Re-enter Ghost. I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me: If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me:Cock crows. If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak! Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.\nMar.: Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\nHor.: Do, if it will not stand.\nBer.: 'Tis here!\nHor.: 'Tis here!\nMar.: 'Tis gone!Exit Ghost. We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.\nBer.: It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\nHor.: And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine: and of the truth herein This present object made probation.\nMar.: It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long: And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\nHor.: So have I heard and do in part believe it. But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill: Break we our watch up; and by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\nMar.: Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently.Exeunt.",

Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, The imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with the dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose,to suppress His further gait herein; in that the levies, The lists and full proportions, are all made Out of his subject: and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway; Giving to you no further personal power To business with the king, more than the scope Of these delated articles allow. Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.\nCor., Volt.: In that and all things will we show our duty.\nKing.: We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius. And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?\nLaer.: My dread lord, Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence though willingly I came to Denmark, To show my duty in your coronation, Yet now, I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\nKing.: Have you your father's leave?What says Polonius?\nPol.: He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laborsome petition, and at last Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent: I do beseech you, give him leave to go.\nKing.: Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,\nHam.: [[Aside]] A little more than kin, and less than kind.\nKing.: How is it that the clouds still hang on you?\nHam.: Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.\nQueen.: Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust: Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.\nHam.: Ay, madam, it is common.\nQueen.: If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?\nHam.: Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected 'haviour of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play: But I have that within which passeth show; These but the trappings and the suits of woe.\nKing.: 'Tis sweet and commendablein your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father: But, you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd: For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd; whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, >From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne; And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart toward you. For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\nQueen.: Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: I pray thee, stay with us: go not to Wittenberg.\nHam.: I shall in all my bestobey you, madam.\nKing.: Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply: Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day, But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the king's rouse the heavens shall bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.Exeunt all but Hamlet.\nHam.: O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on 't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on: and yet, within a month Let me not think on'tFrailty, thy name is woman! A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she follow'd my poor father's body, Like Niobe, all tears:why she, even she O God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, Would have mourn'd longermarried with my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules: within a month: Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not nor it cannot come to good: But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO.\nHor.: Hail to your lordship!\nHam.: I am glad to see you well: Horatio,or I do forget myself.\nHor.: The same, my lord,and your poor servant ever.\nHam.: Sir, my good friend;I'll change that name with you: And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?\nMar.: My good lord\nHam.: I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir. But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\nHor.: A truant disposition, good my lord.\nHam.: I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself: I know you are no truant.

Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio! My father!methinks I see my father.\nHor.: Where, my lord?\nHam.: In my mind's eye, Horatio.\nHor.: I saw him once; he was a goodly king.\nHam.: He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.\nHor.: My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.\nHam.: Saw? who?\nHor.: My lord, the king your father.\nHam.: The king my father?\nHor.: Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.\nHam.: For God's love, let me hear.\nHor.: Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernado, on their watch, In the dead vast and middle of the night, Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did; And I with them the third night kept the watch: Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes: I knew your father; These hands are not more like.\nHam.: But where was this?\nMar.: My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.\nHam.: Did you not speak to it?\nHor.: My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought It lifted up its head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away, And vanish'd from our sight.\nHam.: 'Tis very strange.\nHor.: As I do live, my honor'd lord, 'tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.\nHam.: Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night?\nMar. and Ber.: We do, my lord.\nHam.: Arm'd, say you?\nMar. and Ber.: Arm'd, my lord.\nHam.: From top to toe?\nMar. and Ber.: My lord, from head to foot.\nHam.: Then saw you not his face?\nHor.: O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.\nHam.: What, look'd he frowningly?\nHor.: A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\nHam.: Pale or red?\nHor.: Nay, very pale.\nHam.: And fix'd his eyes upon you?\nHor.: Most constantly.\nHam.: I would I had been there.\nHor.: It would have much amazed you.\nHam.: Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?\nHor.: While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\nMar. and Ber.: Longer, longer.\nHor.: Not when I saw 't.\nHam.: His beard was grizzled,no?\nHor.: It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver'd.\nHam.: I will watch to-night; Perchance 'twill walk again.\nHor.: I warrant it will.\nHam.: If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, Give it an understanding, but no tongue: I will requite your loves. So, fare you well: Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.\nAll.: Our duty to your honour.\nHam.: Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.Exeunt all but Hamlet. My father's spirit in arms! all is not well; I doubt some foul play: would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.Exit.",

    "content": "[A room in Polonius' house.]\n[Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA.]\nLaer.: My necessaries are embark'd: farewell: And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.\nOph.: Do you doubt that?\nLaer.: For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.\nOph.: No more but so?\nLaer.: Think it no more: For nature, crescent, does not grow alone In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will: but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth: He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain, If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmaster'd importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough, If she unmask her beauty to the moon: Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of the spring, Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear: Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.\nOph.: I shall the effect of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven; Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own rede.\nLaer.: O, fear me not. I stay too long: but here my father comes.Enter POLONIUS. A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave.\nPol.: Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee! And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!\nLaer.: Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\nPol.: The time invites you; go; your servantstend.\nLaer.: Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well What I have said to you.\nOph.: 'Tis in my memory locked, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.\nLaer.: Farewell.Exit.\nPol.: What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\nOph.: So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.\nPol.: Marry, well bethought: 'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late Given private time to you; and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous: If it be so, as so 'tis put on me, And that in way of caution, I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? give me up the truth.\nOph.: He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.\nPol.: Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?\nOph.: I do not know, my lord, what I should think.\nPol.: Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby; That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; Ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thusyou'll tender me a fool.\nOph.: My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honorable fashion.\nPol.: Ah, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\nOph.: And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.\nPol.: Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any moment leisure, As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.\nOph.: I shall obey, my lord.Exeunt.",

I heard it not: then it draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within. What does this mean, my lord?\nHam.: The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels; And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.\nHor.: Is it a custom?\nHam.: Ay, marry, is't: But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honor'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations: They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As, in their birthwherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens The form of plausive manners, that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues elsebe they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo Shall in the general censure take corruption >From that particular fault: the dram of eale Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal.\nHor.: Look, my lord, it comes!Enter Ghost.\nHam.: Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws, To cast thee up again. What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous; and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?[Ghost beckons Hamlet.\nHor.: It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.\nMar.: Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground: But do not go with it.\nHor.: No, by no means.\nHam.: It will not speak; then I will follow it.\nHor.: Do not, my lord.\nHam.: Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself? It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.\nHor.: What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness? think of it: The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.\nHam.: It waves me still.

But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine: But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love\nHam.: O God!\nGhost.: Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\nHam.: Murder!\nGhost.: Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange and unnatural.\nHam.: Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.\nGhost.: I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear: 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abused; but know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.\nHam.: O my prophetic soul! My uncle!\nGhost.: Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts, O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen: O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there! From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed, And prey on garbage. But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air; Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd: Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhousel'd, disappointed, unaneled, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head: O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her.

And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart; And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee! Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables,meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:[Writing. So, uncle, there you are.

Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let tell you: For your desire to know what is between us, O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars and soldiers, Give me one poor request.\nHor.: What is't, my lord? we will.\nHam.: Never make known what you have seen to-night.\nHor. and Mar.: My lord, we will not.\nHam.: Nay, but swear 't.\nHor.: In faith, My lord, not I.\nMar.: Nor I, my lord, in faith.\nHam.: Upon my sword.\nMar.: We have sworn, my lord, already.\nHam.: Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.\nGhost.: [[Beneath]] Swear.\nHam.: Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? Come onyou hear this fellow in the cellarage Consent to swear.\nHor.: Propose the oath, my lord.\nHam.: Never to speak of this that you have seen, Swear by my sword.\nGhost.: [[Beneath]] Swear.\nHam.: Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword: Never to speak of this that you have heard, Swear by my sword.\nGhost.: [[Beneath]] Swear.\nHam.: Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast? A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.\nHor.: O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!\nHam.: And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come; Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on, That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,' Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me: this not to do, So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.\nGhost.: [[Beneath]] Swear.\nHam.: Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!They swear.]So, gentlemen, With all my love I do commend me to you: And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do, to express his love and friending to you, God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together; And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. The time is out of joint: O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right! Nay, come, let's go together.[Exeunt.",

Long stay'd he so; At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being: that done, he lets me go: And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd, He seem'd to find his way without his eyes; For out o' doors he went without their helps, And, to the last, bended their light on me.\nPol.: Come, go with me: I will go seek the king. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry. What, have you given him any hard words of late?\nOph.: No, my good lord, but, as you did command, I did repel his letters and denied His access to me.\nPol.: That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgement I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle, And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!

I assure my good liege, I hold my duty, as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king: And I do think, or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.\nKing.: O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.\nPol.: Give first admittance to the ambassadors; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.\nKing.: Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.Exit Polonius. He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper.\nQueen.: I doubt it is no other but the main; His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.\nKing.: Well, we shall sift him.Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS. Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?\nVolt.: Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack; But, better look'd into, he truly found It was against your highness: whereat grieved, That so his sickness, age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys; Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give the assay of arms against your majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack: With an entreaty, herein further shown,[Giving a paper. That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.\nKing.: It likes us well; And at our more consider'd time we'll read, Answer, and think upon this business. Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor: Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together: Most welcome home!Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.\nPol.: This business is well ended. My liege, and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief: your noble son is mad: Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is't but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go.\nQueen.: More matter, with less art.\nPol.: Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure; But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause: Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend. I have a daughterhave while she is mine Who, in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.[Reads.To the celestial and my soul's idol, the mostbeautifiedOphelia,That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified'is a vilephrase: but you shall hear. Thus:Reads.'In her excellent whitebosom, these, &c.'\nQueen.: Came this from Hamlet to her?\nPol.: Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.[Reads.'Doubt thou the stars are fire;Doubt that the sun doth move;Doubt truth to be a liar;But never doubt I love.'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;I have not art toreckon my groans: but thatI love thee best, O most best, believeit. Adieu.'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilstthismachine is to him, HAMLET. This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means and place, All given to mine ear.\nKing.: But how hath she Received his love?\nPol.: What do you think of me?\nKing.: As of a man faithful and honorable.\nPol.: I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I had seen this hot love on the wing As I perceived it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told mewhat might you, Or my dear majesty your queen here, think, If I had play'd the desk or table-book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or look'd upon this love with idle sight; What might you think? No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star; This must not be:' and then I prescripts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice; And he, repulseda short tale to make Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we mourn for.\nKing.: Do you think 'tis this?\nQueen.: It may be, very likely.\nPol.: Hath there been such a timeI'd fain know that That I have positive said ''Tis so,' When it proved otherwise?\nKing.: Not that I know.\nPol.: [[Pointing to his head and shoulders]] Take this from this, if this be otherwise: If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre.\nKing.: How may we try it further?\nPol.: You know, sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.\nQueen.: So he does indeed.\nPol.: At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him: Be you and I behind an arras then; Mark the encounter: if he love her not And be not from his reason fall'n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters.\nKing.: We will try it.\nQueen.: But, look, where sadly the poor wretchcomes reading.\nPol.: Away, I do beseech you, both away: I'll board him presently.Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.Enter HAMLET, reading. O, give me leave:\nPol.: [[Aside]]\nPol.: [[Aside]]\nRos.: [[To Polonius]]\nHam.: Good lads, how do yeboth?\nGuil.: Happy, in that we are not over-happy; On fortune'scap we are not the very button.\nRos.: [[Aside to Guil.]]\nHam.: [[Aside]]\nPol.: [[Aside]]\nHam.: Now I am alone. O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force so his soul to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing! For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing; no, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat, As deep as to the lungs? who does me this? Ha! 'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! O, vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, A scullion! Fie upon 't! foh! About, my brain!I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil: and the devil hath power To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds More relative than this: the play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.[Exit.",

Good gentlemen,give him a further edge, And drive his purpose onto these delights.\nRos.: We shall, my lord.Exeunt Rosencranlz and Guildenstern.\nKing.: Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia: Her father and myself, lawful espials, Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge, And gather by him, as he is behaved, If't be the affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for.\nQueen.: I shall obey you. And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours.\nOph.: Madam, I wish it may.[Exit Queen.\nPol.: Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.[To Ophelia]Read on this book; That show of such an exercise may color Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this, 'Tis too much provedthat with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The devil himself.\nKing.: [[Aside]] O, 'tis too true! How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word: O heavy burthen!\nPol.: I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.Exeunt King and Polonius.Enter HAMLET.\nHam.: To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause: there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action.Soft you now! The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered.\nOph.: Good my lord, How does your honor for this many a day?\nHam.: I humbly thank you; well, well, well.\nOph.: My lord, I have remembrances of yours, That I have longed long to re-deliver; I pray you, now receive them.\nHam.: No, not I; I never gave you aught.\nOph.: My honor'd lord, you know right well you did; And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed As made the things more rich: their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord.\nOph.: O, what a noble mind is here o'er- thrown! The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword; The expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!Re-enter KING and POLONIUS.\nKing.: Love! his affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, Was not like madness. There's something in his soul, O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger: which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England, For the demand of our neglected tribute: Haply the seas and country different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on't?\nPol.: It shall do well: but yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia! You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said; We heard it all. My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit, after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief: let her be round with him; And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference. If she find him not, To England send him, or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.\nKing.: It shall be so: Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.[Exeunt.",

Why should the poor be flatter'd? No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, A man that fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those Whose blood and judgement are so well commingled, That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee.Something too much of this. There is a play to-night before the king; One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father's death: I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgements join In censure of his seeming.\nHor.: Well, my lord: If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\nHam.: They are coming to the play; I must be idle: Get you a place.Danish march. A flourish.Enter KING, QUEEN, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others.\nPol.: [[To the King]]\nPro.: For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently.Exit.\nP. King.: Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground, And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been, Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands hands Unite communtual in most sacred bands.\nP. Queen.: So many journeys may the sun and moon Make again count o'er ere love be done! But, woe is me, you are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must: For women's fear and love holds quantity; In either aught, or in extremity. Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know; And as my love is sized, my fear is so: Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.\nP. King.: 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too; My operant powers their functions leave to do: And thou shalt live in this fair world behind, Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind For husband shalt thou\nP. Queen.: O, confound the rest! Such love must needs be treason in my breast: In second husband let me be accurst! None wed the second but who kill'd the first.\nHam.: [[Aside]] Wormwood, wormwood.\nP. Queen.: The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love: A second time I kill my husband dead, When second husband kisses me in bed.\nP. King.: I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity: Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree; But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be. Most necessary 'tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt: What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy: Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change; For 'tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies; The poor advanced makes friends of enemies, And hitherto doth love on fortune tend; For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown; Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own: So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.\nP. Queen.: Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light! Sport and repose lock from me day and night! To desperation turn my trust and hope! An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope! Each opposite that blanks the face of joy Meet what I would have well and it destroy! Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever I be wife!\nHam.: If she should break it now!\nP.

Soft! now to my mother. O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom: Let me be cruel, not unnatural: I will speak daggers to her, but use none; My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites; How in my words soever she be shent, To give them seals never, my soul, consent!Exit.",

Fare you well, my liege: I'll call upon you ere you go to bed, And tell you what I know.\nKing.: Thanks, dear my lord.Exit Polonius. O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, A brother's murder. Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent; And, like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shall first begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence? And what's in prayer but this two-fold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up; My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer Can serve my term? 'Forgive me my foul murder'? That cannot be; since I am still possess'd Of those effects for which I did the murder, My crown, mine own ambition and my queen. May one be pardon'd and retain the offence? In the corrupted currents of this world Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above; There is no shuffling, there the action lies In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then? what rests? Try what repentance can: what can it not? Yet what can it when one can not repent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul, that, strupgling to be free, Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay! Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe! All may be well.Retires and kneels.Enter HAMLET.\nHam.: Now might I do it pat, now he is praying; And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven; And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd: A villain kills my father; and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge. He took my father grossly, full of bread; With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands who knows save heaven? But in our circumstance and course of thought. 'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No! Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent: When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; At gaming, swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation in't; Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell, whereto it goes.

Ha! have you eyes? You cannot call it love; for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have, Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err, Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd But it reserved some quantity of choice, To serve in such a difference. What devil was't That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will.\nQueen.: O Hamlet, speak no more: Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul; And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct.\nHam.: Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty,\nQueen.: O, speak to me no more; These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears; No more, sweet Hamlet!\nHam.: A murderer and a villain; A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings; A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket!\nQueen.: No more!\nHam.: A king of shreds and patches,Enter Ghost. Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings, You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?\nQueen.: Alas, he's mad!\nHam.: Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command? O, say!\nGhost.: Do not forget: this visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But, look, amazement on thy mother sits: O, step between her and her fighting soul: Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works: Speak to her, Hamlet.\nHam.: How is it with you, lady?\nQueen.: Alas, how is't with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep; And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hair, like life in excrements, Start up, and stand an end. O gentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?\nHam.: On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares! His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones, Would make them capable. Do not look upon me; Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects: then what I have to do Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.\nQueen.: To whom do you speak this?\nHam.: Do you see nothing there?\nQueen.: Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.\nHam.: Nor did you nothing hear?\nQueen.: No, nothing but ourselves.\nHam.: Why, look you there look, how it steals away! My father, in his habit as he lived! Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!Exit Ghost.\nQueen.: This is the very coinage of your brain: This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.\nHam.: Ecstasy ! My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, And makes as healthful music: it is not madness That I have utter'd: bring me to the test, And I the matter will re-word; which madness Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that flattering unction to your soul, That not your trespass, but my madness speaks: It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, Whiles rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven; Repent what's past; avoid what is to come; And do not spread the compost on the weeds, To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\nQueen.: O Hamlet,thou hast cleft my heart in twain.\nHam.: O, throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half. Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed; Assume a virtue, if you have it not. That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat, Of habits devil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery, That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night, And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence: the next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And either....the devil, or throw him out With wondrous potency. Once more, good night: And when you are desirous to be bless'd, I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,[Pointing to Polonius. I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so, To punish me with this and this with me, That I must be their scourge and minister. I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him. So, again, good night. I must be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins and worse remains behind. One word more, good lady.\nQueen.: What shall I do?\nHam.: Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed; Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse; And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers, Make you to ravel all this matter out, That I essentially am not in madness, But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know; For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide? who would do so? No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house's top, Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep, And break your own neck down.\nQueen.: Be thou assured, if words be made of breath, And breath of life, I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me.\nHam.: I must to England; you know that?\nQueen.: Alack, I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.\nHam.: There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows, Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd, They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way, And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; For 'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petar: and't shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines, And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet, When in one line two crafts directly meet. This man shall set me packing: I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor Is now most still, most secret and most grave, Who was in life a foolish prating knave. Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. Good night, mother.Exeunt severally; Hamlet dragging in Polonius.",

Will you be ruled by me?\nLaer.: Ay, my lord; So you will not o'errule me to a peace.\nKing.: To thine own peace. If he be now return'd, As checking at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose but fall: And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, But even his mother shall uncharge the practice And call it accident.\nLaer.: My lord, I will be ruled; The rather, if you could devise it so That I might be the organ.\nKing.: It falls right. You have been talk'd of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.\nLaer.: What part is that, my lord?\nKing.: A very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy: I've seen myself, and served against, the French, And they can well on horseback: but this gallant Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat; And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As had he been incorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought, That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did.\nLaer.: A Norman was't?\nKing.: A Norman.\nLaer.: Upon my life, Lamond.\nKing.: The very same.\nLaer.: I know him well: he is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.\nKing.: He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence And for your rapier most especial, That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed, If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation, He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him. Now, out of this,\nLaer.: What out of this, my lord?\nKing.: Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart?\nLaer.: Why ask you this?\nKing.: Not that I think you did not love your father; But that I know love is begun by time; And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a like goodness still; For goodness, growing to a plurisy, Dies in his own too much: that we would do, We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh, That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer: Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake, To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words?\nLaer.: To cut his throat i' the church.\nKing.: No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home: We'll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager on your heads: he, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice Requite him for your father.\nLaer.: I will do't: And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death.\nKing.: Let's further think of this; Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape: if this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance, 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold, If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see: We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't: When in your motion you are hot and dry And make your bouts more violent to that end And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, Our purpose may hold there.Enter QUEEN. How now, sweet queen!\nQueen.: One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow: your sister's drowned, Laertes.\nLaer.: Drown'd! O, where?\nQueen.: There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; There with fantastic garlands did she come Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them: There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke: When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide; And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up: Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes; As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element: but long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death.\nLaer.: Alas, then, she is drown'd?\nQueen.: Drown'd, drown'd.\nLaer.: Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will: when these are gone, The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord: I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly douts it.Exit.\nKing.: Let's follow, Gertrude: How much I had to do to calm his rage! Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore let's follow.[Exeunt.",

    "content": "[A hall in the castle.]\n[Enter HAMLET and HORATIO.]\nHam.: So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other; You do remember all the circumstance?\nHor.: Remember it, my lord!\nHam.: Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, That would not let me sleep: methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly, And praised be rashness for it, let us know, Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well, When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will,\nHor.: That is most certain.\nHam.: Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark Groped I to find out them; had my desire, Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew To mine own room again; making so bold, My fears forgetting manners, to unseal Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio, O royal knavery!an exact command, Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmark's health and England's too, With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, That, on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off.\nHor.: Is't possible?\nHam.: Here's the commission: read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?\nHor.: I beseech you.\nHam.: Being thus be-netted round with villanies, Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the playI sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair: I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair and labor'd much How to forget that learning, but, sir, now It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote?\nHor.: Ay, good my lord.\nHam.: An earnest conjuration from the king, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma 'tween their amities, Ard many such-like 'As'es of great charge, That, on the view and knowing of these contents. Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-time allow'd.\nHor.: How was this seal'd?\nHam.: Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father's signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal; Folded the writ up in form of the other, Subscribed it, gave 't the impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already.\nHor.: So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.\nHam.: Why, man, they did make love to this employment; They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow: 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites.\nHor.: Why, what a king is this!\nHam.: Does it not, think'st thee, stand me, now upon He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother, Popp'd in between the election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenageis't not perfect conscience, To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd, To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?\nHor.: It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there.\nHam.: It will be short:the interim is mine; And a man's life's no morethan to say 'One.' But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself; For, by the image of my cause, I see The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours: But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion.\nHor.: Peace! who comes here?Enter OSRIC.\nHam.: I be so able as now.\nKing.: Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.[The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.\nHam.: Give me your pardon, sir: I 've done you wrong; But pardon't, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd With sore distraction. What I have done, That might your nature, honour and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet: If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd; His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts, That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house, And hurt my brother.\nLaer.: I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most To my revenge: but in my terms of honour I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement, Till by some elder masters, of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace, To keep my name ungored. But till that time, I do receive your offer'd love like love, And will not wrong it.\nHam.: I embrace it freely; And will this brother's wager frankly play. Give us the foils. Come on.\nLaer.: Come, one for me.\nHam.: I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.\nLaer.: You mock me, sir.\nHam.: No, by this hand.\nKing.: Give them the foils, young Osric.Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?\nHam.: Very well, my lord; Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.\nKing.: I do not fear it;I have seen you both: But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.\nLaer.: This is too heavy,let me see another.\nHam.: This likes me well.These foils have all a length?[They prepare to play.\nOsr.: Ay, my good lord.\nKing.: Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath; And in the cup an union shall he throw, Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn.Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, 'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin: And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\nHam.: Come on, sir.\nLaer.: Come, my lord.They play.\nHam.: One.\nLaer.: No.\nHam.: Judgement.\nOsr.: A hit, a very palpable hit.\nLaer.: Well; again.\nKing.: Stay; give me drink.Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here's to thy health.[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within. Give him the cup.\nHam.: I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.They play. Another hit; what say you?\nLaer.: A touch, a touch, I do confess.\nKing.: Our son shall win.\nQueen.: He's fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows: The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.\nHam.: Good madam!\nKing.: Gertrude, do not drink.\nQueen.: I will, my lord;I pray you, pardon me.\nKing.: [[Aside]] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.\nHam.: I dare not drink yet, madam;by and by.\nQueen.: Come, let me wipe thy face.\nLaer.: My lord, I'll hit him now.\nKing.: I do not think't.\nLaer.: [Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.\nHam.: Come, for the third,Laertes: you but dally; I pray you, pass with our best violence; I am afeard you make a wanton of me.\nLaer.: Say you so? come on.[They play.\nOsr.: Nothing, neither way.\nLaer.: Have at you now![Laertes wounds Hamlet; then,in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.\nKing.: Part them: they are incensed.\nHam.: Nay, come, again.[The Queen falls.\nOsr.: Look to the queen there, ho!\nHor.: They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?\nOsr.: How is't, Laertes?\nLaer.: Why, as a woodcockto mine own springe, Osric; I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.\nHam.: How does the queen?\nKing.: She swounds to see them bleed.\nQueen.: No, no, the drink, the drink,O my dear Hamlet, The drink, the drink!I am poison'd.[Dies.\nHam.: O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd: Treachery! Seek it out.\nLaer.: It is here, Hamlet:Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie, Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.\nHam.: The point envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work.[Stabs the King.\nAll.: Treason! treason!\nKing.: O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.\nHam.: Here, thou incestuous, murderous,damned Dane, Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother.[King dies.\nLaer.: He is justly served; It is a poison temper'd by himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet: Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me![Dies.\nHam.: Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but timeas this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrestO, I could tell you But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied.\nHor.: Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left.\nHam.: As thou'rt a man, Give me the cup:let go; by heaven, I'll have't. O good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story.[March afar off, and shot within. What warlike noise is this?\nOsr.: Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.\nHam.: O, I die, Horatio; The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England; But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, Which have solicited. The rest is silence.[Dies.\nHor.: Now cracks a noble heart.Good night, sweet prince; And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest! Why does the drum come hither?[March within.Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others.\nFort.: Where is this sight?\nHor.: What is it ye would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.\nFort.: This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?\nFirst Amb.: The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late: The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead: Where should we have our thanks?\nHor.: Not from his mouth, Had it the ability of life to thank you: He never gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view; And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about: so shall you hear Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgements, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventor's heads: all this can I Truly deliver.\nFort.: Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune: I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage dothinvite me.\nHor.: Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouthwhose voice will draw on more: But let this same be presently perform'd, Even while men's minds are wild;lest more mischance, On plots and errors, happen.\nFort.: Let four captains Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage; For he was likely, had he been put on, To have proved most royally:and, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies: such a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot.[A dead march.Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal ofordnance is shot off.",

Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head; And this our life exempt from public haunt Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones and good in every thing. I would not change it.\nAmi.: Happy is your grace, That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style.\nDuke S.: Come, shall we go and kill us venison? And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, Being native burghers of this desert city, Should in their own confines with forked heads Have their round haunches gored.\nFirst Lord.: Indeed, my lord, The melancholy Jaques grieves at that, And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you. To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood: To the which place a poor sequester'd stag, That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt, Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting, and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears.\nDuke S.: But what said Jaques? Did he not moralize this spectacle?\nFirst Lord.: O, yes, into a thousand similes. First, for his weeping into the needless stream; 'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more To that which had too much:' then, being there alone, Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends, ''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part The flux of company:' anon a careless herd, Full of the pasture, jumps along by him And never stays to greet him; 'Ay,' quoth Jaques, 'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens; 'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?' Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country, city, court, Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse, To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.\nDuke S.: And did you leave him in this contemplation?\nSec. Lord.: We did, my lord, weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer.\nDuke S.: Show me the place: I love to cope him in these sullen fits, For then he's full of matter.\nFirst Lord.: I'll bring him to you straight[Exeunt.",

O you memory Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here? Why are you virtuous? why do people love you? And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant? Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny priser of the humorous duke? Your praise is come too swiftly home before you. Know you not, master, to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies? No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master, Are sanctified and holy traitors to you. O, what a world is this, when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it!\nOrl.: Why, what's the matter?\nAdam.: O unhappy youth! Come not within these doors; within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives: Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son-- Yet not the son, I will not call him son Of him I was about to call his father-- Hath heard your praises, and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie And you within it: if he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off. I overheard him and his practices. This is no place; this house is but a butchery: Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.\nOrl.: Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?\nAdam.: No matter whither, so you come not here.\nOrl.: What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food? Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road? This I must do, or know not what to do: Yet this I will not do, do how I can; I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.\nAdam.: But do not so. I have five hundred crowns, The thrifty hire I saved under your father, Which I did store to be my foster-nurse When service should in my old limbs lie lame And unregarded age in corners thrown: Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed, Yea, providently caters for the sparrow, Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold; And all this I give you. Let me be your servant: Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty; For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood, Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility; Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you; I'll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities.\nOrl.: O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed! Thou art not for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweat but for promotion, And having that, do choke their service up Even with the having: it is not so with thee. But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree, That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry But come thy ways; we'll go along together, And ere we have thy youthful wages spent, We'll light upon some settled low content.\nAdam.: Master, go on, and I will follow thee, To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty. From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I, but now live here no more. At seventeen years many their fortunes seek; But at fourscore it is too late a week: Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well and not my master's debtor.[Exeunt.",

A table set out.]\n[Enter DUKE senior, AMIENS, and Lords like outlaws.]\nDuke S.: I think he be transform'd into a beast; For I can no where find him like a man.\nFirst Lord.: My lord, he is but even now gone hence: Here was he merry, hearing of a song.\nDuke S.: If he, compact of jars, grow musical, We shall have shortly discord in the spheres. Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.Enter JAQUES.\nFirst Lord.: He saves my labor by his own approach.\nDuke S.: Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, That your poor friends must woo your company? What, you look merrily!\nJaq.: A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest, A motley fool; a miserable world! As I do live by food, I met a fool; Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun, And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms, In good set terms and yet a motley fool. 'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he, 'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:' And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock: Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags: 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, And after one hour more 'twill be eleven; And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe, And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot; And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time, My lungs began to crow like chanticleer, That fools should be so deep-contemplative, And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial. O noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.\nDuke S.: What fool is this?\nJaq.: O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier, And says, if ladies be but young and fair, They have the gift to know it: and in his brain, Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd With observation, the which he vents In mangled forms. O that I were a fool! I am ambitious for a motley coat.\nDuke S.: Thou shalt have one.\nJaq.: It is my only suit; Provided that you weed your better judgements Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise. I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please ; for so fools have; And they that are most galled with my folly, They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so? The 'why' is plain as way to parish church: He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly, although he smart, Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not, The wise man's folly is anatomized Even by the squandering glances of the fool. Invest me in my motley; give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of the infected world, If they will patiently receive my medicine.\nDuke S.: Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.\nJaq.: What, for a counter, would I do but good?\nDuke S.: Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin: For thou thyself hast been a libertine, As sensual as the brutish sting itself; And all the embossed sores and headed evils, That thou with license of free foot hast caught, Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.\nJaq.: Why, who cries out on pride, That can therein tax any private party? Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea, Till that the weary very means do ebb? What woman in the city do I name, When that I say the city-woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders? Who can come in and say that I mean her, When such a one as she such is her neighbor? Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not on my cost, Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech? There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right, Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free, Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies, Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here ?Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn.\nOrl.: Forbear, and eat no more.\nJaq.: Why, I have eat none yet.\nOrl.: Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.\nJaq.: Of what kind should this cock come of?\nDuke S.: Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress, Or else a rude despiser of good manners, That in civility thou seem'st so empty ?\nOrl.: You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred And know some nurture. But forbear, I say: He dies that touches any of this fruit Till I and my affairs are answered.\nDuke S.: What would you have?Your gentleness shall force More than your forcemove us to gentleness.\nOrl.: I almost die for food; and let me have it.\nDuke S.: Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.\nOrl.: Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you: I thought that all things had been savage here; And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time; If ever you have look'd on better days, If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any good man's feast, If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be: In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.\nDuke S.: True is it that we have seen better days, And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd: And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be minister'd.\nOrl.: Then but forbear your food a little while, Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn And give it food. There is an old poor man, Who after me hath many a weary step Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed, Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger, I will not touch a bit.\nDuke S.: Go find him out, And we will nothing waste till you return.\nOrl.: I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort![Exit.\nDuke S.: Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy: This wide and universal theatre Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in.\nJaq.: All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM.\nDuke S.: Welcome. Set down your venerable burden And let him feed.\nOrl.: I thank you most for him.\nAdam.: So had you need: I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.\nDuke S.: Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you As yet, to question you about your fortunes. Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.SONG.\nAmi.: Blow, blow, thou winter wind. Thou art not so unkind As man's ingratitude; Thy tooth is not so keen, Because thou art not seen, Although thy breath be rude. Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly: Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly: Then, heigh-ho, the holly! This life is most jolly. Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, That dost not bite so nigh As benefits forgot: Though thou the waters warp, Thy sting is not so sharp As friend remember'd not. Heigh-ho! sing, &c.\nDuke S.: If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son, As you have whisper'd faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limn'd and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke That loved your father: the residue of your fortune, Go to my cave and tell me.

Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee: Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush, The cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes, Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not, Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes That can do hurt.\nSil.: O dear Phebe, If ever,--as that ever may be near,-- You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy, Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love's keen arrows make.\nPhe.: But till that time Come not thou near me: and when that time comes, Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not; As till that time I shall not pity thee.\nRos.: And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother, That you insult, exult, and all at once, Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,-- As, by my faith, I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed-- Must you be therefore proud and pitiless? Why, what means this? Why do you look on me? I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life, I think she means to tangle my eyes too! No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it: 'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream, That can entame my spirits to your worship. You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her, Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain? You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you That makes the world full of ill-favor'd children: 'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her; And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her. But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees, And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love: For I must tell you friendly in your ear, Sell when you can: you are not for all markets: Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer: Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer. So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.\nPhe.: Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together: I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.\nPhe.: For no ill will I bear you.\nRos.: I pray you, do not fall in love with me, For I am falser than vows made in wine: Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house, 'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by. Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard. Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better, And be not proud: though all the world could see, None could be so abused in sight as he. Come, to our flock.[Exeunt Rosalind, Celia and Corin.\nPhe.: Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, 'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'\nSil.: Sweet Phebe,--\nPhe.: Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?\nSil.: Sweet Phebe, pity me.\nPhe.: Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.\nSil.: Wherever sorrow is, relief would be: If you do sorrow at my grief in love, By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined.\nPhe.: Thou hast my love: is not that neighborly?\nSil.: I would have you.\nPhe.: Why, that were covetousness. Silvius, the time was that I hated thee, And yet it is not that I bear thee love; But since that thou canst talk of love so well, Thy company, which erst was irksome to me, I will endure, and I'll employ thee too: But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.\nSil.: So holy and perfect is my love, And I in such a poverty of grace, That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.\nPhe.: Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?\nSil.: Not very well, but I have met him oft: And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of.\nPhe.: Think not I love him, though I ask for him; 'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well; But what care I for words? yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear. It is a pretty youth: not very pretty: But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him: He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue Did make offence his eye did heal it up. He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall: His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well: There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference Between the constant red and mingled damask. There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him In parcels as I did, would have gone near To fall in love with him; but, for my part, I love him not nor hate him not; and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him: For what had he to do to chide at me? He said mine eyes were black and my hair black: And, now I am remembered, scorn'd at me: I marvel why I answer'd not again: But that's all one; omittance is no quittance. I'll write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?\nSil.: Phebe, with all my heart.\nPhe.: I'll write it straight; The matter's in my head and in my heart: I will be bitter with him and passing short. Go with me, Silvius.[Exeunt.",

When from the first to last betwixt us two Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed, As how I came into that desert place:-- In brief, he led me to the gentle duke, Who gave me fresh array and entertainment, Committing me unto my brother's love; Who led me instantly unto his cave, There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away, Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind. Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound; And, after some small space, being strong at heart, He sent me hither, stranger as I am, To tell this story, that you might excuse His broken promise, and to give this napkin Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.[Rosalind swoons.\nCel.: Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!\nOli.: Many will swoon when they do look on blood.\nCel.: There is more in it.

    "content": "[A hall in the DUKE'S palace.]\n[Enter DUKE, GEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants.]\nge.: Yet this my comfort: when your words are done, My woes end likewise with the evening sun.\nDuke.: Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause Why thou departed'st from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus,\nge.: A heavier task could not have been imposed Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable: Yet, that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence, I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave. In Syracusa was I born, and wed Unto a woman, happy but for me, And by me, had not our hap been bad. With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum; till my factor's death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse: From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself, almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear, Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrived where I was. There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons; And, which was strange, the one so like the other As could not be distinguish'd but by names. That very hour, and in the self-same inn, A meaner woman was delivered Of such a burden, male twins, both alike: Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,-- I bought and brought up to attend my sons. My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys, Made daily motions for our home return: Unwilling I agreed; alas! too soon, We came aboard. A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd, Before the always wind-obeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm: But longer did we not retain much hope; For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death; Which though myself would gladly have embraced, Yet the incessant weepings of my wife, Weeping before for what she saw must come, And piteous plainings of the pretty babes, That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear, Forced me to seek delays for them and me. And this it was, for other means was none: The sailors sought for safety by our boat, And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us: My wife, more careful for the latter-born, Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast, Such as seafaring men provide for storms; To him one of the other twins was bound, Whilst I had been like heedful of the other: The children thus disposed, my wife and I, Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd, Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast; And floating straight, obedient to the stream, Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought. At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, Dispersed those vapors that offended us; And, by the benefit of his wished light, The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered Two ships from far making amain to us, Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this: But ere they came,--O, let me say no more! Gather the sequel by that went before.\nDuke.: Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so; For we may pity, though not pardon thee.\nge.: O, had the gods done so, I had not now Worthily term'd them merciless to us! For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues, We were encounter'd by a mighty rock; Which being violently borne upon, Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst; So that, in this unjust divorce of us, Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in, what to sorrow for. Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened With lesser weight but not with lesser woe, Was carried with more speed before the wind; And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought. At length, another ship had seized on us; And, knowing whom it was their hap to save, Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests; And would have reft the fishers of their prey, Had not their bark been very slow of sail; And therefore homeward did they bend their course. Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss; That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd, To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.\nDuke.: And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Do me the favor to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.\nge.: My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care, At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother: and importuned me That his attendant--so his case was like, Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-- Might bear him company in the quest of him: Whom whilst I labor'd of a love to see, I hazarded the loss of whom I loved. Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece, Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia, And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus; Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men. But here must end the story of my life; And happy were I in my timely death, Could all my travels warrant me they live.\nDuke.: Hapless geon, whom the fates have mark'd To bear the extremity of dire mishap! Now, trust me, were it not against our laws, Against my crown, my oath, my dignity, Which princes, would they, may not disannul, My soul should sue as advocate for thee. But, though thou art adjudged to the death And passed sentence may not be recall'd But to our honor's great disparagement, Yet I will favor thee in what I can. Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help: Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus; Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum, And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die Gaoler, take him to thy custody.\nge.: Hopeless and helpless doth geon wend, But to procrastinate his lifeless end.[Exeunt.",

This very day a Syracusian merchant Is apprehended for arrival here; And not being able to buy out his life According to the statute of the town, Dies ere the weary sun set in the west. There is your money that I had to keep.\nAnt. S.: Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host, And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee. Within this hour it will be dinner-time: Till that, I'll view the manners of the town, Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, And then return and sleep within mine inn, For with long travel I am stiff and weary. Get thee away.\nDro. S.: Many a man would take you at your word, And go indeed, having so good a mean.[Exit.\nAnt. S.: A trusty villain, sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholy, Lightens my humor with his merry jests. What, will you walk with me about the town, And then go to my inn and dine with me?\nFirst Mer.: I am invited, sir, to certain merchants, Of whom I hope to make much benefit; I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock, Please you, I'l meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bed-time: My present business calls me from you now.\nAnt. S.: Farewell till then: I will go lose myself And wander up and down to view the city.\nFirst Mer.: Sir, I commend you to your own content.[Exit.\nAnt. S.: He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get. I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop, Who, falling there to find his fellow forth, Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself: So I, to find a mother and a brother, In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.Enter DROMIO of Ephesus. Here comes the almanac of my true date. What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon ?\nDro. E.: Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late: The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit, The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; My mistress made it one upon my cheek: She is so hot because the meat is cold; The meat is cold because you come not home; You come not home because you have no stomach; You have no stomach having broke your fast; But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray Are penitent for your default to-day.\nAnt. S.: Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray: Where have you left the money that I gave you?\nDro. E.: O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper? The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.\nAnt. S.: I am not in a sportive humor now: Tell me, and dally not, where is the money? We being strangers here, how darest thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody?\nDro. E.: I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner: I from my mistress come to you in post; If I return, I shall be post indeed, For she will score your fault upon my pate. Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock And strike you home without a messenger.\nAnt. S.: Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season; Reserve them till a merrier hour than this. Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?\nDro. E.: To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.\nAnt. S.: Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge,\nDro. E.: My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner: My mistress and her sister stays for you.\nAnt. S.: Now, as I am a Christian, answer me In what safe place you have bestow'd my money, Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed: Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?\nDro. E.: I have some marks of yours upon my pate, Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders, But not a thousand marks between you both. If I should pay your worship those again, Perchance you will not bear them patiently.\nAnt. S.: Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?\nDro. E.: Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix; She that doth fast till you come home to dinner And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.\nAnt. S.: What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.\nDro. E.: What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands! Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.[Exit.\nAnt. S.: Upon my life, by some device or other The villain is o'er-raught of all my money. They say this town is full of cozenage, As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye, Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind, Soul-killing witches that deform the body, Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks, And many such-like liberties of sin: If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner. I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave: I greatly fear my money is not safe.[Exit.",

Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.\nLuc.: Perhaps some merchant hath invited him And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner. Good sister, let us dine and never fret: A man is master of his liberty: Time is their master, and, when they see time, They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.\nAdr.: Why should their liberty than ours be more ?\nLuc.: Because their business still lies out o' door.\nAdr.: Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.\nLuc.: O, know he is the bridle of your will.\nAdr.: There's none but asses will be bridled so.\nLuc.: Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe. There's nothing situate under heaven's eye But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky: The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls Are their males' subjects and at their controls: Men, more divine, the masters of all these, Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas, Indued with intellectual sense and souls, Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls, Are masters to their females, and their lords: Then let your will attend on their accords.\nAdr.: This servitude makes you to keep unwed.\nLuc.: Not this, but troubles of the marriagebed.\nAdr.: But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.\nLuc.: Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.\nAdr.: How if your husband start some other where?\nLuc.: Till he come home again, I would forbear.\nAdr.: Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause; They can be meek that have no other cause. A wretched soul, bruised with adversity, We bid be quiet when we hear it cry; But were we burden'd with like weight of pain, As much or more we should ourselves complain: So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee, With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me; But, if thou live to see like right bereft, This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.\nLuc.: Well, I will marry one day, but to try. Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.Enter DROMIO of Ephesus.\nAdr.: Say, is your tardy master now at hand ?\nAdr.: Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thouhis mind?\nDro. E.: Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.\nDro. E.: Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.\nAdr.: Horn-mad, thou villain!\nDro. E.: I mean not cuckold-mad; But, sure, he is stark mad. When I desired him to come home to dinner, He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold: ''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he: 'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he: 'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he, 'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?' 'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he; 'My mistress, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress! I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'\nLuc.: Quoth who?\nDro. E.: Quoth my master: 'I know,' quoth he, 'no house,no wife, no mistress.' So that my errand, due unto mytongue, I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders; For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.\nAdr.: Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.\nDro. E.: Go back again, and be new beaten home? For God's sake, send some other messenger.\nAdr.: Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.\nDro.

E.: Am I so round with you as you with me, That like a football you do spurn me thus? You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither: If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.[Exit.\nLuc.: Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!\nAdr.: His company must do his minions grace, Whilst I at home starve for a merry look. Hath homely age the alluring beauty took From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it: Are my discourses dull? barren my wit? If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd, Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard: Do their gay vestments his affections bait? That's not my fault: he's master of my state: What ruins are in me that can be found, By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground Of my defeatures. My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair: But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.\nLuc.: Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!\nAdr.: Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense. I know his eye doth homage otherwhere; Or else what lets it but he would be here? Sister, you know he promised me a chain; Would that alone, alone he would detain, So he would keep fair quarter with his bed! I see the jewel best enamelled Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still, That others touch, and often touching will Wear gold: and no man that hath a name, By falsehood and corruption doth it shame. Since that my beauty cannot please his eye, I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.\nLuc.: How many fond fools serve mad jealousy![Exeunt.",

I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mark. See, here he comes.Enter DROMIO of Syracuse. How now, sir! is your merry humor alter'd? As you love strokes, so jest with me again. You know no Centaur? you received no gold? Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner? My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad, That thus so madly thou didst answer me?\nDro. S.: What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?\nAnt. S.: Even now, even here, not half an hour since.\nDro.

Hold, take thou that, and that.[Beating him.\nDro. S.: Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest: Upon what bargain do you give it me?\nAnt. S.: Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you, Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours. When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport, But creep in crannies when he hides his beams. If you will jest with me, know my aspect And fashion your demeanor to my looks, Or I will beat this method in your sconce.\nAnt. S.: Shall I tell you why?\nAnt. S.: Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore,-- For urging it the second time to me.\nDro.

The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear, That never object pleasing in thine eye, That never touch well welcome to thy hand, That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste, Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee. How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it, That thou art thus estranged from thyself? Thyself I call it, being strange to me, That, undividable, incorporate, Am better than thy dear self's better part. Ah, do not tear away thyself from me! For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf, And take unmingled thence that drop again, Without addition or diminishing, As take from me thyself and not me too. How dearly would it touch thee to the quick, Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious And that this body, consecrate to thee, By ruffian lust should be contaminate! Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me And hurl the name of husband in my face And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring And break it with a deep-divorcing vow? I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it. I am possess'd with an adulterate blot; My blood is mingled with the crime of lust: For if we too be one and thou play false, I do digest the poison of thy flesh, Being strumpeted by thy contagion. Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed; I live unstain'd, thou undishonored.\nAnt. S.: Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not: In Ephesus I am but two hours old, As strange unto your town as to your talk; Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd, Want wit in all one word to understand.\nLuc.: Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you! When were you wont to use my sister thus? She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.\nAnt. S.: By Dromio?\nDro.

S.: Villain, thou liest; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.\nDro. S.: I never spake with her in all my life.\nAnt. S.: How can she thus then call us by our names? Unless it be by inspiration.\nAdr.: How ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave, Abetting him to thwart me in my mood! Be it my wrong you are from me exempt, But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine: Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine, Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state, Makes me with thy strength to communicate: If aught possess thee from me, it is dross, Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss; Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.\nAnt. S.: To me she speaks; she moves me for hertheme: What, was I married to her in my dream? Or sleep I now and think I hear all this? What error drives our eyes and ears amiss? Until I know this sure uncertainty, I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.\nLuc.: Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.\nDro. S.: O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner. This is the fairy land: O spite of spites! We talk with goblins, owls and sprites: If we obey them not, this will ensue, They'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue.\nLuc.: Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?

'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me.\nAdr.: Come, come, no longer will I be a fool, To put the finger in the eye and weep, Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn. Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate. Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks. Sirrah, if any ask you for your master, Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter. Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.\nAnt. S.: Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell? Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised? Known unto these, and to myself disguised! I'll say as they say and persever so, And in this mist at all adventures go.\nDro.

If you did wed my sister for her wealth, Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness: Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth; Muffle your false love with some show of blindness: Let not my sister read it in your eye; Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator; Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty; Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger; Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted; Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint; Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?

But her fair sister, Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace, Of such enchanting presence and discourse, Hath almost made me traitor to myself: But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong, I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.Enter ANGELO with the chain.\nAng.: Master Antipholus,--\nAnt. S.: Ay, that's my name.\nAng.: I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain. I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine: The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.\nAnt. S.: What is your will that I shall do with this?\nAng.: What please yourself, sir: I have made it foryou.\nAnt. S.: Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.\nAng.: Not once, nor twice, but twenty times youhave. Go home with it and please your wife withal; And soon at supper-time I'll visit you And then receive my money for the chain.\nAnt. S.: I pray you, sir, receive the money now, For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.\nAng.: You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.[Exit.\nAnt. S.: What I should think of this, I cannot tell: But this I think, there's no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain. I see a man here needs not live by shifts, When in the streets he meets such golden gifts. I'll to the mart and there for Dromio stay: If any ship put out, then straight away.[Exit.",

Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, I will discharge my bond and thank you too.Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's.\nOff.: That labor may you save; see where he comes.\nAnt. E.: While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow Among my wife and her confederates, For locking me out of my doors by day. But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone; Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.\nDro. E.: I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.[Exit.\nAnt. E.: A man is well holp up that trusts to you: I promised your presence and the chain; But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me. Belike you thought our love would last too long, If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.\nAng.: Saving your merry humor, here's the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion, Which doth amount to three odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman: I pray you, see him presently discharged, For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.\nAnt. E.: I am not furnish'd with the present money; Besides, I have some business in the town.

Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye That he did plead in earnest? yea or no? Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily? What observation madest thou in this case Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?\nLuc.: First he denied you had in him no right.\nAdr.: He meant he did me none; the more my spite.\nLuc.: Then swore he that he was a stranger here.\nAdr.: And true he swore, though yet forsworn hewere.\nLuc.: Then pleaded I for you.\nAdr.: And what said he?\nLuc.: That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.\nAdr.: With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?\nLuc.: With words that in an honest suit might move. First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.\nAdr.: Didst speak him fair?\nLuc.: Have patience, I beseech.\nAdr.: I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still; My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will. He is deformed, crooked, old and sere, Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere; Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind, Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.\nLuc.: Who would be jealous then of such a one? No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.\nAdr.: Ah, but I think him better than I say, And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.

S.: No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell. A devil in an everlasting garment hath him: One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel; A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough; A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff; A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well; One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.\nAdr.: Why, man, what is the matter?\nDro. S.: I do not know the matter: he is 'rested onthe case.\nAdr.: What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.\nDro.

Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?\nAdr.: Go fetch it, sister.Exit Luciana. This I wonder at, That he, unknown to me, should be in debt, Tell me, was he arrested on a band?\nDro. S.: Not on a band, but on a stronger thing; v A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?\nAdr.: What, the chain?\nDro.

A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats, And for the same he promised me a chain: Both one and other he denies me now. The reason that I gather he is mad, Besides this present instance of his rage, Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner, Of his own doors being shut against his entrance. Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits, On purpose shut the doors against his way. My way is now to hie home to his house, And tell his wife that, being lunatic, He rush'd into my house and took perforce My ring away.

It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing, And thereof comes it that his head is light. Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings: Unquiet meals make ill digestions; Thereof the raging fire of fever bred; And what's a fever but a fit of madness? Thou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls: Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy, Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, And at her heels a huge infectious troop Of pale distemperatures and foes to life? In food, in sport and life-preserving rest To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast: The consequence is then thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.\nLuc.: She never reprehended him but mildly.

Once did I get him bound and sent him home, Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went, That here and there his fury had committed. Anon, I wot not by what strong escape, He broke from those that had the guard of him; And with his mad attendant and himself, Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords, Met us again and madly bent on us, Chased us away; till, raising of more aid, We came again to bind them. Then they fled Into this abbey, whither we pursued them: And here the abbess shuts the gates on us And will not suffer us to fetch him out, Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence. Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.\nDuke.: Long since thy husband served me in my wars, And I to thee engaged a prince's word, When thou didst make him master of thy bed, To do him all the grace and good I could.

He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you, To scorch your face and to disfigure you.[Cry within. Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress: fly, be gone!\nDuke.: Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard andhalberds!\nAdr.: Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you, That he is borne about invisible: Even now we housed him in the abbey here; And now he's there, past thought of human reason.Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus.\nAnt. E.: Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice! Even for the service that long since I did thee, When I bestrid thee in the wars and took Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.\nge.: Unless the fear of death doth make me dote, I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.\nAnt. E.: Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there! She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife, That hath abused and dishonor'd me Even in the strength and height of injury! Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.\nDuke.: Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.\nAnt. E.: This day, great duke, she shut the doorsupon me, While she with harlots feasted in my house.\nDuke.: A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?\nAdr.: No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister To-day did dine together. So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal!\nLuc.: Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night, But she tells to your highness simple truth!\nAng.: O perjured woman! They are both forsworn: In this the madman justly chargeth them.\nAnt. E.: My liege, I am advised what I say, Neither disturbed with the effect of wine, Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire, Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner: That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her, Could witness it, for he was with me then; Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, Where Balthazar and I did dine together. Our dinner done, and he not coming thither, I went to seek him: in the street I meet him And in his company that gentleman. There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down That I this day of him received the chain, Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which He did arrest me with an officer. I did obey, and sent my peasant home For certain ducats: he with none return'd Then fairly I bespoke the officer To go in person with me to my house. By the way we met My wife, her sister, and a rabble more Of vile confederates. Along with them They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain, A mere anatomy, a mountebank, A threadbare juggler and a forutne-teller, A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch, A living-dead man: this pernicious slave, Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse, And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me, Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence And in a dark and dankish vault at home There left me and my man, both bound together; Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, I gain'd my freedom and immediately Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction For these deep shames and great indignities.\nAng.: My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him, That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.\nDuke.: But had he such a chain of thee or no?\nAng.: He had, my lord: and when he ran in here, These people saw the chain about his neck.\nSec. Mer.: Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first foreswore it on the mart: And thereupon I drew my sword on you; And then you fled into this abbey here, From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.\nAnt. E.: I never came within these abbeywalls, Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me: I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven! And this is false you burden me withal.\nDuke.: Why, what an intricate impeach is this! I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup. If here you housed him, here he would have been; If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly: You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?\nDro. E.: Sir, he dined with her there, at thePorpentine.\nCour.: He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.\nAnt. E.: 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.\nDuke.: Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here ?\nCour.: As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.\nDuke.: Why, this is strange. Go call the abbesshither. I think you are all mated or stark mad.[Exit one to the Abbess.\nge.: Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word: Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me.\nDuke.: Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.\nge.: Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus ? And is not that your bondman, Dromio?\nDro. E.: Within this hour I was his bondman, sir, But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords: Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.\nge.: I am sure you both of you remember me.\nDro. E.: Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you; For lately we were bound, as you are now You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?\nge.: Why look you strange on me? you knowme well.\nAnt. E.: I never saw you in my life till now.\nge.: O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last, And careful hours with time's deformed hand Have written strange defeatures in my face: But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?\nAnt. E.: Neither.\nge.: Dromio, nor thou?\nDro. E.: No, trust me, sir, nor I.\nge.: I am sure thou dost.\nge.: Not know my voice! O time's extremity, Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years, that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares? Though now this grained face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow, And all the conduits of my blood froze up, Yet hath my night of life some memory, My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, My dull deaf ears a little use to hear: All these old witnesses--I cannot err-- Tell me thou art my son Antipholus,\nAnt. E.: I never saw my father in my life.\nge.: But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy, Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son, Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.\nAnt. E.: The duke and all that know me in the city Can witness with me that it is not so: I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.\nDuke.: I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years Have I been patron to Antipholus, During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa: I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.Re-enter Abbess, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuseand DROMIO of Syracuse.\nAbb.: Most mighty duke, behold a man muchwrong'd.[All gather to see them.\nAdr.: I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.\nDuke.: One of these men is Genius to the other; And so of these. Which is the natural man, And which the spirit? who deciphers them?\nDro. S.: I, sir, am Dromio: command him away.\nDro. E.: I, sir, am Dromio: pray, let me stay.\nAnt. S.: geon art thou not? or else his ghost?\nDro. S.: O, my old master! who hath bound himhere?\nAbb.: Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty. Speak, old geon, if thou be'st the man That hadst a wife once call'd milia That bore thee at a burden two fair sons: O, if thou be'st the same geon, speak, And speak unto the same milia!\nge.: If I dream not, thou art milia: If thou art she, tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft?\nAbb.: By men of Epidamnum he and I And the twin Dromio all were taken up; But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth By force took Dromio and my son from them And me they left with those of Epidamnum. What then became of them I cannot tell; I to this fortune that you see me in.\nDuke.: Why, here begins his morning story right: These two Antipholuses, these two so like, And these two Dromios, one in semblance,-- Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,-- These are the parents to these children, Which accidentally are met together. Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?\nAnt. S.: No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.\nDuke.: Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.\nAnt. E.: I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--\nDro. E.: And I with him.\nAnt. E.: Brought to this town by that most famouswarrior, Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.\nAdr.: Which of you two did dine with me to-day ?\nAnt. S.: I, gentle mistress.\nAdr.: And are not you my husband?\nAnt. E.: No; I say nay to that.\nAnt. S.: And so do I; yet did she call me so: And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here, Did call me brother.[To Luc.What I told you then, I hope I shall have leisure to make good; If this be not a dream I see and hear.\nAng.: That is the chain, sir, which you had ofme.\nAnt. S.: I think it be, sir; I deny it not.\nAnt. E.: And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.\nAng.: I think I did, sir; I deny it not.\nAdr.: I sent you money, sir, to be your bail, By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.\nDro. E.: No, none by me.\nAnt. S.: This purse of ducats I received from you, And Dromio, my man, did bring them me. I see we still did meet each other's man, And I was ta'en for him, and he for me, And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.\nAnt. E.: These ducats pawn I for my father here.\nDuke.: It shall not need; thy father hath his life.\nCour.: Sir, I must have that diamond from you.\nAnt. E.: There, take it; and much thanks for my goodcheer.\nAbb.: Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes: And all that are assembled in this place, That by this sympathized one day's error Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company, And we shall make full satisfaction. Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you, my sons; and till this present hour My heavy burthen ne'er delivered. The duke, my husband and my children both, And you the calendars of their nativity, Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me; After so long grief, such festivity!\nDuke.: With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast.[Exeunt all but Ant. S., Ant. E., Dro. S., and Dro. E.\nDro. S.: Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard ?\nAnt. E.: Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?\nDro. S.: Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.\nAnt. S.: He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio: Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon: Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.[Exeunt Ant. S. and Ant. E.\nDro. S.: There is a fat friend at your master's house, That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner: She now shall be my sister, not my wife.\nDro. E.: Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth. Will you walk in to see their gossiping?\nDro. S.: Not I, sir; you are my elder.\nDro. E.: That's a question: how shall we try it?\nDro. S.: We'll draw cuts for the senior: till thenlead thou first.\nDro. E.: Nay, then, thus: We came into the world like brother and brother; And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.[Exeunt.",

    "content": "[Rome. A street.]\n[Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves,clubs, and other weapons.]\nMen.: What work's, my countrymen, in hand?where go you With bats and clubs? The matter?speak, I pray you.\nMen.: Why, masters, my good friends, mine honestneighbors, Will you undo yourselves?\nMen.: I tell you, friends, most charitable care Have the patricians of you. For your wants, Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them Against the Roman state, whose course will on The way it takes, crackling ten thousand curbs Of more strong link asunder than can ever Appear in your impediment. For the dearth, The gods, not the patricians, make it, and Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack, You are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you, and you slander The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers, When you curse them as enemies.\nMen.: Either you must Confess yourselves wondrous malicious, Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it; But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture To stale't a little more.\nMen.: There was a time when all the body's members Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it: That only like a gulf it did remain I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive, Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel, And, mutually participate, did minister Unto the appetite and affection common Of the whole body. The belly answer'd\nFirst Cit.: Well, sir, what answer made the belly ?\nMen.: Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile, Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus, For, look you, I may make the belly smile As well as speakit tauntingly replied To the discontented members, the mutinous parts That envied his receipt; even so most fitly As you malign our senators for that They are not such as you.\nFirst Cit.: Your belly's answer? What? The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye, The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier, Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter, With other muniments and petty helps In this our fabric, if that they\nMen.: What then? 'Fore me, this fellow speaks!What then? what then?\nFirst Cit.: Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd, Who is the sink o' the body,\nMen.: Well, what then?\nFirst Cit.: The former agents, if they did complain, What could the belly answer?\nMen.: I will tell you; If you'll bestow a smallof what you have little Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.\nFirst Cit.: Ye're long about it.\nMen.: Note me this, good friend; Your most grave belly was deliberate, Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd: 'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he, 'That I receive the general food at first, Which you do live upon; and fit it is, Because I am the store-house and the shop Of the whole body: but, if you do remember, I send it through the rivers of your blood, Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain; And, through the cranks and offices of man, The strongest nerves and small inferior veins From me receive that natural competency Whereby they live: and though that all at once, You, my good friends,'this says the belly, mark me,\nFirst Cit.: Ay, sir; well, well.\nMen.: 'Though all at once cannot See what I do deliver out to each, Yet I can make my audit up, that all From me do back receive the flour of all, And leave me but the bran.' What say you to 't?\nFirst Cit.: It was an answer: how apply you this ?\nMen.: The senators of Rome are this good belly, And you the mutinous members; for examine Their counsels and their cares: digest things rightly Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find No public benefit which you receive But it proceeds or comes from them to you And no way from yourselves. What do you think, You, the great toe of this assembly?\nFirst Cit.: I the great toe! why the great toe?\nMen.: For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest, Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost: Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run, Lead'st first to win some vantage. But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs: Rome and her rats are at the point of battle; The one side must have bale.Enter CAIUS MARCIUS. Hail, noble Marcius.\nMar.: Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, Make yourselves scabs?\nFirst Cit.: We have ever your good word.\nMar.: He that will give good words to thee will flatter Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs, That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you, The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you, Where he should find you lions, finds you hares; Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no, Than is the coal of fire upon the ice, Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is To make him worthy whose offence subdues him And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate; and your affections are A sick man's appetite, who desires most that Which would increase his evil. He that depends Upon your favours swims with fins of lead And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye? With every minute you do change a mind, And call him noble that was now your hate, Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter, That in these several places of the city You cry against the noble senate, who, Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else Would feed on one another? What's their seeking ?\nMen.: For corn at their own rates; whereof they say, The city is well stored.\nMar.: Hang 'em! They say! They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise, Who thrives and who declines; side factions and give out Conjectural marriages; making parties strong And feebling such as stand not in their liking Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough! Would the nobility lay aside their ruth, And let me use my sword, I'ld make a quarry With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high As I could pick my lance.\nMen.: Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded; For though abundantly they lack discretion, Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you, What says the other troop?\nMar.: They are dissolved: hang 'em! They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs, That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat, That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds They vented their complainings; which being answer'd, And a petition granted them, a strange one To break the heart of generosity, And make bold power look palethey threw their caps As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon, Shouting their emulation.\nMen.: What is granted them?\nMar.: Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms, Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus, Sicinius Velutus, and I know not'Sdeath! The rabble should have first unroof'd the city, Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time Win upon power and throw forth greater themes For insurrection's arguing.\nMen.: This is strange.\nMar.: Go, get you home, you fragments!Enter a Messenger, hastily.\nMess.: Where's Caius Marcius?\nMar.: Here: what's the matter?\nMess.: The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.\nMar.: I am glad on't: then we shall ha' means to vent Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.Enter COMINIUS, TITUSLARTIUS, and other Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS.\nFirst Sen.: Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us; The Volsces are in arms.\nMar.: They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't. I sin in envying his nobility, And were I any thing but what I am, I would wish me only he.\nCom.: You have fought together.\nMar.: Were half to half the world by the ears and he Upon my party, I'ld revolt, to make Only my wars with him: he is a lion That I am proud to hunt.\nFirst Sen.: Then, worthy Marcius, Attend upon Cominius to these wars.\nCom.: It is your former promise.\nMar.: Sir, it is; And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face. What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?\nTit.: No, Caius Marcius; I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other, Ere stay behind this business.\nMen.: O, true-bred!\nFirst Sen.: Your company to the Capitol; where, I know, Our greatest friends attend us.\nTit.: [To Com.] Lead you on.To Mar. Follow Cominius; we must followyou; Right worthy you priority.\nCom.: Noble Marcius!\nFirst Sen.: [To the Citizens] Hence to your homes; be gone!\nMar.: Nay, let them follow: The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners, Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus.\nSic.: Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?\nBru.: He has no equal.\nSic.: When we were chosen tribunes for the people,\nBru.: Mark'd you his lip and eyes?\nSic.: Nay, but his taunts.\nBru.: Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods\nSic.: Be-mock the modest moon.\nBru.: The present wars devour him: he is grown Too proud to be so valiant.\nSic.: Such a nature, Tickled with good success, disdainsthe shadow Which he treads on at noon: but I dowonder His insolence can brook to be commanded UnderCominius.\nBru.: Fame, at the which he aims, In whom already he's well graced, can not Better be held nor more attain'd than by A place below the first: for what miscarries Shall be the general's fault, though he perform To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he Had borne the business!'\nSic.: Besides, if things go well, Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall Of his demerits rob Cominius.\nBru.: Come: Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius, Though Marcius earn'd them not, and all his faults To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed In aught he merit not.\nSic.: Let's hence, and hear How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion, More than his singularity, he goes Upon this present action.\nBru.: Let's along.Exeunt.",

When we granted that, Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you: Your most sweet voices: now you have left your voices, I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery ?\nSic.: Why either were you ignorant to see 't, Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness To yield your voices?\nBru.: Could you not have told him As you were lesson'd, when he had no power, But was a petty servant to the state, He was your enemy, ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving A place of potency and sway o' the state, If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might Be curses, to yourselves? You should have said That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices and Translate his malice towards you into love, Standing your friendly lord.\nSic.: Thus to have said, As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd Either his gracious promise, which you might, As cause had call'd you up, have held him to; Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature, Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage, You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler And pass'd him unelected.\nBru.: Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves, and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you, When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgement?\nSic.: Have you Ere now denied the asker?and now again Of him that did not ask, but mock,bestow Your sued-for tongues?\nThird Cit.: He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.\nSec. Cit.: And will deny him: I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.\nFirst Cit.: I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.\nBru.: Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends, They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties: make them of no more voice Than dogs that are as often beat for barking As therefore kept to do so.\nSic.: Let them assemble, And on a safer judgementall revoke Your ignorant election; enforce his pride, And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not With what contempt he wore the humble weed, How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves, Thinking upon his services, took from you The apprehension of his present portance, Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion After the inveterate hate he bears you.\nBru.: Lay A fault on us, your tribunes;that we labour'd, No impediment between,but that you must Cast your election on him.\nSic.: Say, you chose him More after our commandmentthan as guided By your own true affections, and thatyour minds, Pre-occupied with what you rather must do Than what you should, made you against the grain To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.\nBru.: Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you, How youngly he began to serve his country, How long continued, and what stock he springs of, The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son, Who, after great Hostilius, here was king; Of the same house Publius and Quintus were, That our best water brought by conduits hither; And [Censorinus,] nobly named so, Twice being [by the people chosen] censor, Was his great ancestor.\nSic.: One thus descended, That hath beside well in his person wrought To be set high in place, we did commend To your remembrances: but you have found, Scaling his present bearing with his past, That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke Your sudden approbation.\nBru.: Say, you ne'er had done 't Harp on that stillbut by our putting on: And presently, when you have drawn your number, Repair to the Capitol.\nAll.: We will so: almost all Repent in their election.Exeunt Citizens.\nBru.: Let them go on; This mutiny were better put in hazard, Than stay, past doubt, for greater: If, as his nature is, he fall in rage With their refusal, both observe and answer The vantage of his anger.\nSic.: To the Capitol, come: We will be there before the stream o' the people; And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own, Which we have goaded onward.Exeunt.",

Welcome home.Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS. Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them; For they do prank them in authority, Against all noble sufferance.\nSic.: Pass no further.\nCor.: Ha! what is that?\nBru.: It will be dangerous to go on: no further.\nCor.: What makes this change?\nMen.: The matter?\nCom.: Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?\nBru.: Cominius, no.\nCor.: Have I had children's voices?\nFirst Sen.: Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.\nBru.: The people are incensed against him.\nSic.: Stop, Or all will fall in broil.\nCor.: Are these your herd? Must these have voices, that can yield them now And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices? You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth? Have you not set them on?\nMen.: Be calm, be calm.\nCor.: It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot, To curb the will of the nobility: Suffer 't, and live with such as cannot rule Nor ever will be ruled.\nBru.: Call't not a plot: The people cry you mock'd them, and of late, When corn was given them gratis, you repined; Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.\nCor.: Why, this was known before.\nBru.: Not to them all.\nCor.: Have you inform'd them sithence?\nBru.: How! I inform them!\nCom.: You are like to do such business.\nBru.: Not unlike, Each way, to better yours.\nCor.: Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds, Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me Your fellow tribune.\nSic.: You show too much of that For which the people stir: if you will pass To where you are bound, you must inquire your way, Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit, Or never be so noble as a consul, Nor yoke with him for tribune.\nMen.: Let's be calm.\nCom.: The people are abused; set on. This paltering Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely I' the plain way of his merit.\nCor.: Tell me of corn This was my speech,and I will speak 't again\nMen.: Not now, not now.\nFirst Sen.: Not in this heat, sir, now.\nCor.: Now, as I live, I will.My nobler friends, I crave their pardons: For the mutable, rank-scented many,let them Regard me as I do not flatter,and Therein behold themselves: I say again, In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd, By mingling them with us, the honour'd number, Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that Which they have given to beggars.\nMen.: Well, no more.\nFirst Sen.: No more words, we beseech you.\nCor.: How! no more! As for my country I have shed my blood, Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs Coin words till their decay against those measles, Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought The very way to catch them.\nBru.: You speak o' the people, As if you were a godto punish, not A man of their infirmity.\nSic.: 'Twere well We let the people know't.\nMen.: What, what? his choler?\nCor.: Choler! Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, By Jove! 'twould be my mind!\nSic.: It is a mind That shall remain a poisonwhere it is, Not poison any further.\nCor.: Shall remain! Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you His absolute 'shall'?\nCom.: 'Twas from the canon.\nCor.: 'Shall'! O good but most unwise patricians! why, You grave but reckless senators, have you thus Given Hydra here to choose an officer, That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit To say he'll turn your current in a ditch, And make your channel his? If he have power, Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd, Be not as common fools; if you are not, Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians, If they be senators: and they are no less, When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate, And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,' His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself! It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches To know, when two authorities are up, Neither supreme, how soon confusion May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take The one by the other.\nCom.: Well, on to the market-place.\nCor.: Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used Sometime in Greece,\nMen.: Well, well, no more of that.\nCor.: Though there the people had more absolute power, I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed The ruin of the state.\nBru.: Why, shall the people give One that speaks thus their voice?\nCor.: I'll give my reasons, More worthier than their voices. They know the corn Was not our recompense, resting well assured They ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war, Even when the navel of the state was touch'd, They would not thread the gates. This kind of service Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war. Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation Which they have often made against the senate, All cause unborn, could never be the motive Of our so frank donation. Well, what then? How shall this bisson multitude digest The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express What's like to be their words: 'We did request it; We are the greater poll, and in true fear They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase The nature of our seats and make the rabble Call our cares fears; which will in time Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in The crows to peck the eagles.\nMen.: Come, enough.\nBru.: Enough, with over-measure.\nCor.: No, take more: What may be sworn by, both divine and human, Seal what I end withal! This double worship, Where one part does disdain with cause, the other Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom, Cannot conclude but by the yea and no Of general ignorance,it must omit Real necessities, and give way the while To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, it follows, Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you, You that will be less fearful than discreet, That love the fundamental part of state More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer A noble life before a long, and wish To jump a body with a dangerous physic That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour Mangles true judgement and bereaves the state Of that integrity which should become't, Not having the power to do the good it would, For the ill which doth control't.\nBru.: Has said enough.\nSic.: Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer As traitors do.\nCor.: Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee! What should the people do with these bald tribunes ? On whom depending, their obedience fails To the greater bench: in a rebellion, When what's not meet, but what must be was law, Then were they chosen: in a better hour, Let what is meet be said it must be meet, And throw their power i' the dust.\nBru.: Manifest treason!\nSic.: This a consul? no.\nBru.: The diles, ho!Enter an dile. Let him be apprehended,\nSic.: Go, call the people:Exit dilein whose name myself Attach thee as a traitorous innovator, A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee, And follow to thine answer.\nCor.: Hence, old goat!\nSenators, &c.: We'll surety him.\nCom.: Aged sir, hands off.\nCor.: Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones Out of thy garments.\nSic.: Help, ye citizens!Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the diles.\nMen.: On both sides more respect.\nSic.: Here's he that would take from you all yourpower.\nBru.: Seize him, diles!\nCitizens.: Down with him! down with him!\nSenators, &c.: Weapons, weapons, weapons!They all bustle about Coriolanus, crying 'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!' 'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!' 'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'\nMen.: What is about to be? I am out of breath; Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes To the people! Coriolanus, patience! Speak, good Sicinius.\nSic.: Hear me, people; peace!\nCitizens.: Let's hear our tribune: peace! Speak; speak,speak.\nSic.: You are at point to lose your liberties: Marcius would have all from you; Marcius, Whom late you have named for consul.\nMen.: Fie, fie, fie! This is the way to kindle, not toquench.\nFirst Sen.: To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.\nSic.: What is the city but the people?\nCitizens.: True, The people are the city.\nBru.: By the consent of all, we were establish'd Thepeople's magistrates.\nCitizens.: You so remain.\nMen.: And so are like to do.\nCom.: That is the way to lay the city flat; To bring the roof to the foundation, And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges, In heaps and piles of ruin.\nSic.: This deserves death.\nBru.: Or let us stand to our authority, Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce, Upon the part o' the people, in whose power We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy Of present death.\nSic.: Therefore lay hold of him; Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence Into destruction cast him.\nBru.: diles, seize him!\nCitizens.: Yield, Marcius, yield!\nMen.: Hear me one word; Beseech you, tribunes,hear me but a word.\nd.: Peace, peace!\nMen.: [To Brutus] Be that you seem, truly your country's friend, And temperately proceed to what you would Thus violently redress.\nBru.: Sir, those cold ways, That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him, And bear him to the rock.\nCor.: No, I'll die here.Drawing his sword. There's some among you have beheld me fighting: Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.\nMen.: Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdrawawhile.\nBru.: Lay hands upon him.\nMen.: Help Marcius, help, You that be noble; helphim, young and old!\nCitizens.: Down with him, down with himlIn this mutiny, the Tribunes, the diles, and thePeople, are beat in.\nMen.: Go, get you to your house; be gone, away! All will be naught else.\nSec. Sen.: Get you gone.\nCom.: Stand fast; We have as many friends as enemies.\nMen.: Shall it be put to that?\nFirst Sen.: The gods forbid! I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house; Leave us to cure this cause.\nMen.: For 'tis a sore upon us, You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.\nCom.: Come, sir, along with us.\nCor.: I would they were barbariansas they are, Though in Rome litter'dnot Romansas they are not, Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol\nMen.: Be gone; Put not your worthy rage into your tongue; One time will owe another.\nCor.: On fair ground I could beat forty of them.\nMen.: I could myself Take up a brace o' the best ofthem; yea, the two tribunes.\nCom.: But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic; And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands Against a falling fabric. Will you hence, Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend Like interrupted waters and o'erbear What they are used to bear.\nMen.: Pray you, be gone: I'll try whether my old wit be in request With those that have but little: this must be patch'd With cloth of any colour.\nCom.: Nay, come away.Exeunt Coriolanus,Cominius, and others.\nA Patrician.: This man has marr'd his fortune.\nMen.: His nature is too noble for the world: He would not flatter Neptune for his trident, Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth: What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent; And, being angry, does forget that ever He heard the name of death.A noise within. Here's goodly work!\nSec. Pat.: I would they were a-bed!\nMen.: I would they were in Tiber!What the vengeance! Could he not speak 'em fair?Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble.\nSic.: Where is this viper That would depopulate the city and Be every man himself?\nMen.: You worthy tribunes,\nSic.: He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law, And therefore law shall scorn him further trial Than the severity of the public power Which he so sets at nought.\nFirst Cit.: He shall well know The noble tribunes arethe people's mouths, And we their hands.\nCitizens.: He shall, sure on't.\nMen.: Sir, sir,\nSic.: Peace!\nMen.: Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt With modest warrant.\nSic.: Sir, how comes't that you Have holpto make this rescue?\nMen.: Hear me speak: As I do knowthe consul's worthiness, So can I name his faults,\nSic.: Consul! what consul?\nMen.: The consul Coriolanus.\nBru.: He consul!\nCitizens.: No, no, no, no, no.\nMen.: If, by the tribunes' leave,and yours, good people, I may be heard, I would crave a word or two; The which shall turn you to no further harm Than so much loss of time.\nSic.: Speak briefly then; For we are peremptory to dispatch This viperous traitor: to eject him hence Were but one danger, and to keep him here Our certain death: therefore it is decreed He dies to-night.\nMen.: Now the good gods forbid That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude Towards her deserved children is enroll'd In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam Should now eat up her own!\nSic.: He's a disease that must be cut away.\nMen.: O, he's a limb that has but a disease; Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy. What has he done to Rome that's worthy death? Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath, By many an ouncehe dropp'd it for his country; And what is left, to lose it by his country, Were to us all, that do't and suffer it, A brand to the end o' the world.\nSic.: This is clean kam.\nBru.: Merely awry: when he did love his country, It honour'd him.\nMen.: The service of the foot Being once gangrened, is not then respected For what before it was.\nBru.: We'll hear no more. Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence; Lest his infection, being of catching nature, Spread further.\nMen.: One word more, one word. This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process; Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out, And sack great Rome with Romans.\nBru.: If it were so,\nSic.: What do ye talk? Have we not had a taste of his obedience? Our diles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.\nMen.: Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd In bolted language; meal and bran together He throws without distinction. Give me leave, I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him Where he shall answer, by a lawful form, In peace, to his utmost peril.\nFirst Sen.: Noble tribunes, It is the humane way: the other course Will prove too bloody, and the end of it Unknown to the beginning.\nSic.: Noble Menenius, Be you then as the people's officer. Masters, lay down your weapons.\nBru.: Go not home.\nSic.: Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there: Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed In our first way,\nMen.: I'll bring him to you.To the Senators Let me desire your company: he must come, Or what is worst will follow.\nFirst Sen.: Pray you, let's to him.Exeunt.",

I talk of you: Why did you wish me milder? would you have me False to my nature? Rather say I play The man I am.\nVol.: O, sir, sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on, Before you had worn it out.\nCor.: Let go.\nVol.: You might have been enough the man you are, With striving less to be so: lesser had been The thwartings of your dispositions, if You had not show'd them how ye were disposed Ere they lack'd power to cross you.\nCor.: Let them hang.\nA Patrician.: Ay, and burn too.Enter MENENIUS and Senators.\nMen.: Come, come, you have been too rough, somethingtoo rough; You must return and mend it.\nFirst Sen.: There's no remedy; Unless, by not so doing, our good city Cleave in the midst, and perish.\nVol.: Pray, be counsell'd: I have a heart as little apt as yours, But yet a brain that leads my use of anger To better vantage.\nMen.: Well said, noble woman!

I cannot do it to the gods; Must I then do't to them?\nVol.: You are too absolute; Though therein you can never be too noble, But when extremities speak.

Now, this no more dishonours you at all Than to take in a town with gentle words, Which else would put you to your fortune and The hazard of much blood. I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake required I should do so in honour: I am in this, Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles; And you will rather show our general louts How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em, For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard Of what that want might ruin.\nMen.: Noble lady! Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so, Not what is dangerous present, but the loss Of what is past.\nVol.: I prithee now, my son, Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand; And thus far having stretch'd ithere be with them Thy knee bussing the stonesfor in such business Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant More learned than the earswaving thy head, Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart, Now humble as the ripest mulberry That will not hold the handling: or say to them, Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess, Were fit for thee to use as they to claim, In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far As thou hast power and person.\nMen.: This but done, Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours; For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free As words to little purpose.\nVol.: Prithee now, Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower.Here is Cominius.Enter COMINIUS.\nCom.: I have been i' the market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit, You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.\nMen.: Only fair speech.\nCom.: I think 'twill serve, if he Can thereto frame hisspirit.\nVol.: He must, and will. Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.\nCor.: Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce? Must I with base tongue give my noble heart A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't: Yet, were there but this single plot to lose, This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it And throw 't against the wind. To the marketplace! You have put me now to such a part which never I shall discharge to the life.\nCom.: Come, come, we'll prompt you.\nVol.: I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said My praises made thee first a soldier, so, To have my praise for this, perform a part Thou hast not done before.\nCor.: Well, I must do't: Away, my disposition, and possess me Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd, Which quired with my drum, into a pipe Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees, Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his That hath received an alms! I will not do't, Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth And by my body's action teach my mind A most inherent baseness.\nVol.: At thy choice, then: To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list. Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me, But owe thy pride thyself.\nCor.: Pray, be content: Mother, I am going to the market-place; Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves, Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going: Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul; Or never trust to what my tongue can do I' the way of flattery further.\nVol.: Do your will.Exit.\nCom.: Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself To answer mildly; for they are prepared With accusations, as I hear, more strong Than are upon you yet.\nCor.: The word is 'mildly.'

O, come, go in, And take our friendly senators by the hands; Who now are here, taking their leaves of me, Who am prepared against your territories, Though not for Rome itself.\nCor.: You bless me, gods!\nAuf.: Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have The leading of thine own revenge, take The one half of my commission; and set down As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st Thy country's strength and weakness,thine own ways; Whether to knock against the gates of Rome, Or rudely visit them in parts remote, To fright them, ere destroy. But come in: Let me commend thee first to those that shall Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes! And more a friend than e'er an enemy; Yet, Marcius, that was much.

But as a discontented friend, grief-shot With his unkindness? say't be so?\nSic.: Yet your good will Must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure As you intended well.\nMen.: I'll undertake 't: I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me. He was not taken well; he had not dined: The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then We pout upon the morning, are unapt To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd These pipes and these conveyances of our blood With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him Till he be dieted to my request, And then I'll set upon him.\nBru.: You know the very road into his kindness, And cannot lose your way.\nMen.: Good faith, I'll prove him, 60 Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge Of my success.Exit.\nCom.: He'll never hear him.\nSic.: Not?\nCom.: I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him; 'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me Thus, with his speechless hand; what he would do, He sent in writing after me; what he would not, Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions: So that all hope is vain, Unless his noble mother,and his wife; Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence, And with our fair entreaties haste them on.Exeunt.",

Their latest refuge Was to send him; for whose old love I have, Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd The first conditions, which they did refuse And cannot now accept; to grace him only That thought he could do more, a very little I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits, Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter Will I lend ear to.

I will not.Enter, in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA,and Attendants. My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection! All bond and privilege of nature, break! Let it be virtuous to be obstinate. What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes, Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows; As if Olympus to a molehill should In supplication nod: and my young boy Hath an aspect of intercession, which Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces Plough Rome, and harrow Italy: I'll never Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand, As if a man were author of himself And knew no other kin.\nVir.: My lord and husband!\nCor.: These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.\nVir.: The sorrow that delivers us thus changed Makes you think so.\nCor.: Like a dull actor now, I have forgot my part,and I am out, Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh, Forgive my tyranny; but do not say For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge! Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate, And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;Kneels. Of thy deep duty more impression show Than that of common sons.\nVol.: O, stand up blest! Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint, I kneel before thee; and unproperly Show duty, as mistaken all this while Between the child and parent.Kneels.\nCor.: What is this? Your knees to me? to your corrected son? Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun; Murdering impossibility, to make What cannot be, slight work.\nVol.: Thou art my warrior; I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?\nCor.: The noble sister of Publicola, The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle That's curdled by the frost from purest snow And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!\nVol.: This is a poor epitome of yours, Which by the interpretation of full time May show like all yourself.\nCor.: The god of soldiers, With the consent of supreme Jove, inform Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw, And saving those that eye thee!\nVol.: Your knee, sirrah.\nCor.: That's my brave boy!\nVol.: Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself, Are suitors to you.\nCor.: I beseech you, peace: Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before: The thing I have forsworn to grant may never Be held by your denials. Do not bid me Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not To allaymy rages and revenges with Your colder reasons.\nVol.: O, no more, no more! You have said you will not grant us any thing; For we have nothing else to ask, but that Which you deny already: yet we will ask; That, if you fail in our request, the blame May hang upon your hardness: therefore, hear us.\nCor.: Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?\nVol.: Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment And state of bodies would bewray what life We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself How more unfortunate than all living women Are we come hither: since that thy sight, which should Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts, Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow; Making the mother, wife and child to see The son, the husband and the father tearing His country's bowels out. And to poor we Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort That all but we enjoy; for how can we, Alas, how can we for our country pray, Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person, Our comfort in the country. We must find An evident calamity, though we had Our wish, which side should win: for either thou Must, as a foreign recreant, be led With manacles through our streets, or else Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin, And bear the palm for having bravely shed Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son, I purpose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee Rather to show a noble grace to both parts Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner March to assault thy country than to tread Trust to 't, thou shalt noton thy mother's womb, That brought thee to this world.\nVir.: Ay, and mine, That brought you forth this boy,to keep your name Living to time.\nYoung Mar.: A' shall not tread on me; I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.\nCor.: Not of a woman's tenderness to be, Requires nor child nor woman's face to see. I have sat too long.Rising.\nVol.: Nay, go not from us thus. If it were so that our request did tend To save the Romans, thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us, As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit Is, that you reconcile them: while the Volsces May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans, 'This we received;' and each in either side Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be blest For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son, The end of war's uncertain, but this certain, That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name, Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses; Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble, But with his last attempt he wiped it out; Destroy'd his country, and his name remains To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son: Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour, To imitate the graces of the gods; To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air, And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak ? Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you: He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy: Perhaps thy childishness will move him more Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world More bound to's mother; yet here he lets me prate Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy, When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood, Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home, Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust, And spurn me back: but if it be not so, Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee, That thou restrain'st from me the duty which To a mother's part belongs. He turns away: Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees. To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end; This is the last: so we will home to Rome, And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's: This boy, that cannot tell what he would have, But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship, Does reason our petition with more strength Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go: This fellow had a Volscian to his mother; His wife is in Corioli and his child Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch: I am hush'd until our city be afire, And then I'll speak a little.He holds her by the hand, silent.\nCor.: O mother, mother! What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope, The gods look down, and this unnatural scene They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O! You have won a happy victory to Rome; But, for your son,believe it, O, believe it, Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd, If not most mortal to him. But, let come. Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius, Were you in my stead, would you have heard A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?\nAuf.: I was moved withal.\nCor.: I dare be sworn you were: And, sir, it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir, What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part, I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you, Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!\nAuf.: [Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour At difference in thee: out of that I'll work Myself a former fortune.The Ladies make signs to Coriolanus.\nCor.: Ay, by and by;To Volumnia, Virgilia, &c. But we will drink together;and you shall bear A better witness back than words, which we, On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd. Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve To have a temple built you: all the swords In Italy, and her confederate arms, Could not have made this peace.Exeunt.",

No harm, I trust, is done?\nPis.: There might have been, But that my master rather play'd than fought And had no help of anger: they were parted By gentlemen at hand.\nQueen.: I am very glad on't.\nImo.: Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part. To draw upon an exile! O brave sir! I would they were in Afric both together; Myself by with a needle, that I might prick The goer-back. Why came you from your master?\nPis.: On his command: he would not suffer me To bring him to the haven; left these notes Of what commands I should be subject to, When't pleased you to employ me.\nQueen.: This hath been Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honor He will remain so.\nPis.: I humbly thank your highness.\nQueen.: Pray, walk awhile.\nImo.: About some half-hour hence, I pray you, speak with me:you shall at least Go see my lord aboard:for this time leave me.[Exeunt.",

Be revenged; Or she that bore you was no queen, and you Recoil from your great stock.\nImo.: Revenged! How should I be revenged? If this be true,-- As I have such a heart that both mine ears Must not in haste abuse--if it be true, How should I be revenged?\nIach.: Should he make me Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets, While he is vaulting variable ramps, In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it. I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure, More noble than that runagate to your bed, And will continue fast to your affection, Still close as sure.\nImo.: What, ho, Pisanio!\nIach.: Let me my service tender on your lips.\nImo.: Away! I do condemn mine ears that have So long attended thee. If thou wert honorable, Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far From thy report as thou from honor, and Solicit'st here a lady that disdains Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio! The king my father shall be made acquainted Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit, A saucy stranger in his court to mart As in a Romish stew and to expound His beastly mind to us, he hath a court He little cares for and a daughter who He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!\nIach.: O happy Leonatus! I may say: The credit that thy lady hath of thee Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness Her assured credit. Blessed live you long! A lady to the worthiest sir that ever Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon. I have spoke this, to know if your affiance Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord, That which he is, new o'er: and he is one The truest manner'd; such a holy witch That he enchants societies into him; Half all men's hearts are his.\nImo.: You make amends.\nIach.: He sits 'mongst men like a descended god: He hath a kind of honor sets him off, More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry, Most mighty princess, that I have adventured To try your taking of a false report; which hath Honor'd with confirmation your great judgement In the election of a sir so rare, Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you, Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.\nImo.: All's well, sir:take my power i' the court for yours.\nIach.: My humble thanks. I had almost forgot To entreat your grace but in a small request, And yet of moment too, for it concerns Your lord; myself and other noble friends Are partners in the business.\nImo.: Pray, what is't?\nIach.: Some dozen Romans of us and your lord-- The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums To buy a present for the emperor; Which I, the factor for the rest, have done In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels Of rich and exquisite form; their values great; And I am something curious, being strange, To have them in safe stowage: may it please you To take them in protection?\nImo.: Willingly; And pawn mine honor for their safety: since My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them In my bedchamber.\nIach.: They are in a trunk, Attended by my men: I will make bold To send them to you, only for this night; I must aboard to-morrow.\nImo.: O, no, no.\nIach.: Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word By lengthening my return. From Gallia I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise To see your grace.\nImo.: I thank you for your pains: But not away to-morrow!\nIach.: O, I must, madam: Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please To greet your lord with writing, do't tonight: I have outstood my time; which is material To the tender of our present.\nImo.: I will write.

By this, your king Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius Will do's commission throughly: and I think He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages, Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance Is yet fresh in their grief.\nPost.: I do believe, Statist though I am none, nor like to be, That this will prove a war; and you shall hear The legions now in Gallia sooner landed In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen Are men more order'd than when Julius Csar Smiled at their lack of skill, but found their courage Worthy his frowning at: their discipline, Now mingled with their courages, will make known To their approvers they are people such That mend upon the world.Enter IACHIMO.\nPhi.: See!

To feed again, though full. You do remember This stain upon her?\nPost.: Ay, and it doth confirm Another stain, as big as hell can hold, Were there no more but it.\nIach.: Will you hear more?\nPost.: Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns; Once, and a million!\nIach.: I'll be sworn--\nPost.: No swearing. If you will swear you have not done't, you lie; And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny Thou'st made me cuckold.\nIach.: I'll deny nothing.\nPost.: O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!

Stoop, boys; this gate Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through And keep their impious turbans on, without Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven! We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly As prouder livers do.\nGui.: Hail, heaven!\nArv.: Hail, heaven!\nBel.: Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill; Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider, When you above perceive me like a crow, That it is place which lessens and sets off: And you may then revolve what tales I have told you Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war: This service is not service, so being done But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus, Draws us a profit from all things we see; And often, to our comfort, shall we find The sharded beetle in a safer hold Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life Is nobler than attending for a check, Richer than doing nothing for a bauble, Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk: Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine, Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.\nGui.: Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged, Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not What air's from home. Haply this life is best, If quiet life be best; sweeter to you That have a sharper known; well corresponding With your stiff age: but unto us it is A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed; A prison for a debtor, that not dares To stride a limit.\nArv.: What should we speak of When we are old as you? when we shall hear The rain and wind beat dark December, how, In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing; We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey, Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat; Our valor is to chase what flies; our cage We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird, And sing our bondage freely.\nBel.: How you speak! Did you but know the city's usuries And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court, As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb Is certain falling, or so slippery that The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war, A pain that only seems to seek out danger I' the name of fame and honor; which dies i' the search, And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph As record of fair act; nay, many times, Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse, Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story The world may read in me: my body's mark'd With Roman swords, and my report was once First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me, And when a soldier was the theme, my name Was not far off: then was I as a tree Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night, A storm of robbery, call it what you will, Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves, And left me bare to weather.\nGui.: Uncertain favor!\nBel.: My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft-- But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline I was confederate with the Romans: so Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years This rock and these demesnes have been my world; Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid More pious debts to heaven than in all The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains! This is not hunters' language: he that strikes The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast; To him the other two shall minister; And we will fear no poison, which attends In place of greater state.I'll meet you in the valleys.[Exeunt Guiderius and Arviragus. How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature! These boys know little they are sons to the king; Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive. They think they are mine;and though train'd up thus meanly I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them In simple and low things to prince it much Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore, The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove! When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out Into my story: say 'Thus mine enemy fell, And thus I set my foot on's neck;' even then The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats, Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal, Once Arviragus, in as like a figure, Strikes life into my speech and shows much more His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused! O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon, At three and two years old, I stole these babes; Thinking to bar thee of succession, as Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile, Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother, And every day do honor to her grave: Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd, They take for natural father. The game is up.[Exit.",

Against self-slaughter There is a prohibition so divine That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart. Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence; Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?

Though peril to my modesty, not death on't, I would adventure.\nPis.: Well, then, here's the point: You must forget to be a woman; change Command into obedience: fear and niceness-- The handmaids of all women, or, more truly, Woman it pretty self--into a waggish courage: Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek, Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!

    "content": "[A room in Cymbeline's palace.]\n[Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS,Lords, and Attendants.]\nCym.: Thus far; and so farewell.\nLuc.: Thanks, royal sir. My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence; And am right sorry that I must report ye My master's enemy.\nCym.: Our subjects, sir, Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself To show less sovereignty than they, must needs Appear unkinglike.\nLuc.: So, sir; I desire of you A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven. Madam, all joy befal your grace!\nQueen.: And you!\nCym.: My lords, you are appointed for that office; The due of honor in no point omit. So farewell, noble Lucius.\nLuc.: Your hand, my lord.\nClo.: Receive it friendly; but from this time forth I wear it as your enemy.\nLuc.: Sir, the event Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.\nCym.: Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords, Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness![Exeunt Lucius and Lords.\nQueen.: He goes hence frowning: but it honors us That we have given him cause.\nClo.: 'Tis all the better; Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.\nCym.: Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness: The powers that he already hath in Gallia Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves His war for Britain.\nQueen.: 'Tis not sleepy business; But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.\nCym.: Our expectation that it would be thus Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen, Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd The duty of the day: she looks us like A thing more made of malice than of duty: We have noted it. Call her before us; for We have been too slight in sufferance.[Exit an Attendant.\nQueen.: Royal sir, Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord, 'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty, Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady So tender of rebukes that words are strokes And strokes death to her.Re-enter Attendant.\nCym.: Where is she, sir? How Can her contempt be answer'd?\nAtten.: Please you, sir, Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer That will be given to the loudest noise we make.\nQueen.: My lord, when last I went to visit her, She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close, Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity, She should that duty leave unpaid to you, Which daily she was bound to proffer: this She wish'd me to make known; but our great court Made me to blame in memory.\nCym.: Her doors lock'd? Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear Prove false![Exit.\nQueen.: Son, I say, follow the king.\nClo.: That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant, I have not seen these two days.\nQueen.: Go, look after.[Exit Cloten. Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus! He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes It is a thing most precious. But for her, Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her, Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown To her desired Posthumus: gone she is To death or to dishonor; and my end Can make good use of either: she being down, I have the placing of the British crown.Re-enter CLOTEN. How now, my son!\nClo.: 'Tis certain she is fled. Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none Dare come about him.\nQueen.: [[Aside]] All the better: may This night forestall him of the coming day![Exit.\nClo.: I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal, And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one The best she hath, and she, of all compounded, Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but Disdaining me and throwing favors on The low Posthumus slanders so her judgement That what's else rare is choked; and in that point I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed, To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--Enter PISANIO. Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah? Come hither: ah, you precious pandar! Villain, Where is thy lady? In a word; or else Thou art straightway with the fiends.\nPis.: O, my good lord!\nClo.: Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter,-- I will not ask again. Close villain, I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus? From whose so many weights of baseness cannot A dram of worth be drawn.\nPis.: Alas, my lord, How can she be with him? When was she miss'd? He is in Rome.\nClo.: Where is she, sir? Come nearer; No further halting: satisfy me home What is become of her.\nPis.: O, my all-worthy lord!\nClo.: All-worthy villain! Discover where thy mistress is at once, At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!' Speak, or thy silence on the instant is Thy condemnation and thy death.\nPis.: Then, sir, This paper is the history of my knowledge Touching her flight.[Presenting a letter.\nClo.: Let's see 't. I will pursue her Even to Augustus' throne.\nPis.: [[Aside]] Or this, or perish. She's far enough; and what he learns by this May prove his travel, not her danger.\nClo.: Hum!\nPis.: [[Aside]] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen, Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!\nPis.: Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee Were to prove false, which I will never be, To him that is most true. To Milford go, And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow, You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed Be cross'd with slowness; labor be his meed![Exit.",

I should be sick, But that my resolution helps me. Milford, When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee, Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean, Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie, That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder, When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord! Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee, My hunger's gone; but even before, I was At point to sink for food. But what is this? Here is a path to 't: 'tis some savage hold: I were best not call; I dare not call: yet famine, Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant. Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here? If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage, Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter. Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't. Such a foe, good heavens![Exit, to the cave.Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.\nBel.: You, Polydore, have proved best woodman and Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match: The sweat of industry would dry and die, But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs Will make what's homely savoury: weariness Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here, Poor house, that keep'st thyself!\nGui.: I am thoroughly weary.\nArv.: I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.\nGui.: There is cold meat i' the cave: we'll browse on that, Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.\nBel.: [[Looking into the cave]] Stay; come not in. But that it eats our victuals, I should think Here were a fairy.\nGui.: What's the matter, sir?\nBel.: By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not, An earthly paragon! Behold divineness No elder than a boy!Re-enter IMOGEN.\nImo.: Good masters, harm me not: Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought To have begg'd or bought what I have took: good troth, I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat: I would have left it on the board so soon As I had made my meal, and parted With prayers for the provider.\nGui.: Money, youth?\nArv.: All gold and silver rather turn to dirt! As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those Who worship dirty gods.\nImo.: I see you're angry: Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should Have died had I not made it.\nBel.: Whither bound?\nImo.: To Milford-Haven.\nBel.: What's your name?\nImo.: Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford; To whom being going, almost spent with hunger, I am fall'n in this offence.\nBel.: Prithee, fair youth Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd! 'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer Ere you depart; and thanks to stay and eat it. Boys, bid him welcome.\nGui.: Were you a woman, youth, I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty, I bid for you as I'ld buy.\nArv.: I'll make't my comfort He is a man; I'll love him as my brother: And such a welcome as I'ld give to him After long absence, such is yours: most welcome! Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.\nImo.: 'Mongst friends, If brothers.[Aside] Would it had been so, that they Had been my father's sons! then had my prize Been less, and so more equal ballasting To thee, Posthumus.\nBel.: He wrings at some distress.\nGui.: Would I could free't!\nArv.: Or I, whate'er it be, What pain it cost, what danger. Gods!\nBel.: Hark, boys![Whispering.\nImo.: Great men, That had a court no bigger than this cave, That did attend themselves and had the virtue Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by That nothing-gift of differing multitudes-- Could not out-peer these twain.

I am very sick.\nGui.: Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.\nImo.: So sick I am not, yet I am not well; But not so citizen a wanton as To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me; Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom Is breach of all.

What are you That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers? I have heard of such.

What art thou? Have not I An arm as big as thine? a heart as big? Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art. Why I should yield to thee?\nClo.: Thou villain base, Know'st me not by my clothes?\nGui.: No, nor thy tailor, rascal, Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes, Which, as it seems, make thee.\nClo.: Thou precious varlet, My tailor made them not.\nGui.: Hence, then, and thank The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool; I am loath to beat thee.\nClo.: Thou injurious thief, Hear but my name, and tremble.\nGui.: What's thy name?\nClo.: Cloten, thou villain.\nGui.: Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name, I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or Adder, Spider, 'Twould move me sooner.\nClo.: To thy further fear, Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know I am the son to the queen.\nGui.: I am sorry for't; not seeming So worthy as thy birth.\nClo.: Art not afeard?\nGui.: Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise: At fools I laugh, not fear them.\nClo.: Die the death: When I have slain thee with my proper hand, I'll follow those that even now fled hence, And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads: Yield, rustic mountaineer.Exeunt, fighting.Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS.\nBel.: No companies abroad?\nArv.: None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.\nBel.: I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him, But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favor Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice, And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute 'Twas very Cloten.\nArv.: In this place we left them: I wish my brother make good time with him, You say he is so fell.\nBel.: Being scarce made up, I mean, to man, he had not apprehension Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgement Is oft the cause of fear.But, see, thy brother.Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head.\nGui.: This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse; There was no money in 't: not Hercules Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none: Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne My head as I do his.\nBel.: What hast thou done?\nGui.: I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head, Son to the queen, after his own report; Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore With his own single hand he'ld take us in, Displace our heads where--thank the gods!-- they grow, And set them on Lud's-town.\nBel.: We are all undone.\nGui.: Why, worthy father, what have we to lose, But that he swore to take, our lives? The law Protects not us: then why should we be tender To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us, Play judge and executioner all himself, For we do fear the law? What company Discover you abroad?\nBel.: No single soul Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason He must have some attendants. Though his humor Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not Absolute madness could so far have raved To bring him here alone; although perhaps It may be heard at court that such as we Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time May make some stronger head; the which he hearing-- As it is like him--might break out, and swear He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable To come alone, either he so undertaking, Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear, If we do fear this body hath a tail More perilous than the head.\nArv.: Let ordinance Come as the gods foresay it; howsoe'er, My brother hath done well.\nBel.: I had no mind To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness Did make my way long forth.\nGui.: With his own sword, Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek Behind our rock; and let it to the sea, And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten: That's all I reck.[Exit.\nBel.: I fear 'twill be revenged: Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done't! though valor Becomes thee well enough.\nArv.: Would I had done't, So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore, I love thee brotherly, but envy much Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges, That possible strength might meet, would seek us through And put us to our answer.\nBel.: Well, 'tis done: We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger Where's there no profit. I prithee, to our rock; You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him To dinner presently.\nArv.: Poor sick Fidele! I'll willingly to him: to gain his color I'ld let a parish of such Clotens blood, And praise myself for charity.[Exit.\nBel.: O thou goddess, Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st In these two princely boys! They are as gentle As zephyrs blowing below the violet, Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough, Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind, That by the top doth take the mountain pine, And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder That an invisible instinct should frame them To royalty unlearn'd, honor untaught, Civility not seen from other, valor That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange What Cloten's being here to us portends, Or what his death will bring us.Re-enter GUIDERIUS.\nGui.: Where's my brother? I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream, In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage For his return.[Solemn music.\nBel.: My ingenious instrument! Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!\nGui.: Is he at home?\nBel.: He went hence even now.\nGui.: What does he mean?since death of my dear'st mother It did not speak before. All solemn things Should answer solemn accidents. The matter? Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys Is jollity for apes and grief for boys. Is Cadwal mad?\nBel.: Look, here he comes, And brings the dire occasion in his arms Of what we blame him for.Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his arms.\nArv.: The bird is dead That we have made so much on. I had rather Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty, To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch, Than have seen this.\nGui.: O sweetest, fairest lily! My brother wears thee not the one half so well As when they grew'st thyself.\nBel.: O melancholy! Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare Might easiliest harbor in? Thou blessed thing! Jove knows what man thou might'st have made; but I, Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy. How found you him?\nArv.: Stark, as you see: Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber, Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his right cheek Reposing on a cushion.\nGui.: Where?\nArv.: O' the floor; His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness Answer'd my steps too loud.\nGui.: Why, he but sleeps: If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed; With female fairies will his tomb be haunted, And worms will not come to thee.\nArv.: With fairiest flowers Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele, I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander, Out-sweeten'd not thy breath; the ruddock would, With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie Without a monument!--bring thee all this; Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none, To winter-ground thy corse.\nGui.: Prithee, have done; And do not play in wench-like words with that Which is so serious. Let us bury him, And not protract with admiration what Is now due debt. To the grave!\nArv.: Say, where shall's lay him?\nGui.: By good Euriphile, our mother.\nArv.: Be't so: And let us, Polydore, though now our voices Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground, As once our mother; use like note and words, Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.\nGui.: Cadwal, I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee; For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse Than priests and fanes that lie.\nArv.: We'll speak it, then.\nBel.: Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys; And though he came our enemy, remember He was paid for that: though mean and mighty, rotting Together, have one dust, yet reverence, That angel of the world, doth make distinction Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely; And though you took his life, as being our foe, Yet bury him as a prince.\nGui.: Pray you, fetch him hither. Thersites' body is as good as Ajax', When neither are alive.\nArv.: If you'll go fetch him, We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.[Exit Belarius.\nGui.: Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east; My father hath a reason for't.\nArv.: 'Tis true.\nGui.: Come on then, and remove him.\nArv.: So. Begin,SONG.\nGui.: Fear no more the heat o' the sun, Nor the furious winter's rages; Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:\" Golden lads and girls all must, As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.\nArv.: Fear no more the frown o' the great; Thou art past the tyrant's stroke; Care no more to clothe and eat; To thee the reed is as the oak: The sceptre, learning, physic, must All follow this, and come to dust.\nGui.: Fear no more the lightning-flash,\nArv.: Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;\nGui.: Fear not slander, censure rash;\nArv.: Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:\nBoth.: All lovers young, all lovers must Consign to thee, and come to dust.\nGui.: No exorciser harm thee!\nArv.: Nor no witchcraft charm thee!\nGui.: Ghost unlaid forbear thee!\nArv.: Nothing ill come near thee!\nBoth.: Quiet consummation have;And renowned be thy grave!Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTEN.\nGui.: We have done our obsequies:come, lay him down.\nBel.: Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more: The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces. You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so These herblets shall, which we upon you strew. Come on, away: apart upon our knees. The ground that gave them first has them again: Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.[Exeunt Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.\nImo.: [[Awaking]] Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is the way?-- I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither? 'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?-- I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep. But, soft! no bedfellow!--O gods and goddesses![Seeing the body of Cloten. These flowers are like the pleasures of the world; This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream; For so I thought I was a cave-keeper, And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so; 'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing, Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes Are sometimes like our judgements, blind. Good faith, I tremble still with fear: but if there be Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it! The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt. A headless man! The garments of Posthumus! I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand; His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh; The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face-- Murder in heaven?--Hoy!--'Tis gone. Pisanio, All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks, And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou, Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten, Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio-- From this most bravest vessel of the world Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas, Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me! where's that? Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart, And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio? 'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant! The drug he gave me, which he said was precious And cordial to me, have I not found it Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home: This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O! Give color to my pale cheek with thy blood, That we the horrider may seem to those Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord![Falls on the body.Enter Lucius, a Captain and other Officers, and a Soothsayer.\nCap.: To them the legions garrison'd in Gallia, After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending You here at Milford-Haven with your ships: They are in readiness.\nLuc.: But what from Rome?\nCap.: The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits, That promise noble service: and they come Under the conduct of bold Iachimo, Syenna's brother.\nLuc.: When expect you them?\nCap.: With the next benefit o' the wind.\nLuc.: This forwardness Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers Be muster'd; bid the captains look to 't. Now, sir, What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?\nSooth.: Last night the very gods show'd me a vision-- I fast and pray'd for their intelligence-thus: I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd From the spongy south to this part of the west, There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends-- Unless my sins abuse my divination-- Success to the Roman host.\nLuc.: Dream often so, And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime It was a worthy building. How! a page! Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather; For nature doth abhor to make his bed With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead. Let's see the boy's face.\nCap.: He's alive, my lord.\nLuc.: He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one, Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems They crave to be demanded. Who is this Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he That, otherwise than noble nature did, Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it? What art thou?\nImo.: I am nothing: or if not, Nothing to be were better. This was my master, A very valiant Briton and a good, That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas! There is no more such masters: I may wander From east to occident, cry out for service, Try many, all good, serve truly, never Find such another master.\nLuc.: 'Lack, good youth! Thou movest no less with thy complaining than Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.\nImo.: Richard du Champ.[Aside]If I do lie and do No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?\nLuc.: Thy name?\nImo.: Fidele, sir.\nLuc.: Thou dost approve thyself the very same: Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name. Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure, No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters, Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.\nImo.: I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods, I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave. And on it said a century of prayers, Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh; And leaving so his service, follow you, So please you entertain me.\nLuc.: Ay, good youth; And rather father thee than master thee. My friends, The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can, And make him with our pikes and partisans A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes: Some falls are means the happier to arise.[Exeunt.",

The heavens still must work. Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true. These present wars shall find I love my country, Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.

By villany I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel; Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may grieve thee, As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived 'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?\nCym.: All that belongs to this.\nIach.: That paragon, thy daughter,-- For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.\nCym.: My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength: I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.\nIach.: Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock That struck the hour--it was in Rome,--accursed The mansion where! 'twas at a feast,--O, would Our viands had been poison'd, or at least Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus-- What should I say? he was too good to be Where ill men were; and was the best of all Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly, Hearing us praise our loves of Italy For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva, Postures beyond brief nature, for condition, A shop of all the qualities that man Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving, Fairness which strikes the eye--\nCym.: I stand on fire: Come to the matter.\nIach.: All too soon I shall, Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus, Most like a noble lord in love and one That had a royal lover, took his hint; And, not dispraising whom we praised,-- therein He was as calm as virtue--he began His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made, And then a mind put in't, either our brags Were crack'd of kitchen-trulls, or his description Proved us unspeaking sots.\nCym.: Nay, nay, to the purpose.\nIach.: Your daughter's chastity--there it begins. He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams, And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch, Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore Upon his honor'd finger, to attain In suit the place of's bed and win this ring By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight, No lesser of her honor confident Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring; And would so, had it been a carbuncle Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain Post I in this design: well may you, sir, Remember me at court; where I was taught Of your chaste daughter the wide difference 'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain 'Gan in your duller Britain operate Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent: And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd, That I return'd with simular proof enough To make the noble Leonatus mad, By wounding his belief in her renown With tokens thus, and thus; averring notes Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,-- O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks Of secret on her person, that he could not But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd, I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon-- Methinks, I see him now--\nPost.: [[Advancing]] Ay, so thou dost, Italian fiend! Ay, me, most credulous fool, Egregious murderer, thief, any thing That's due to all the villains past, in being, To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison, Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out For torturers ingenious: it is I That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend By being worse than they. I am Posthumus, That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie-- That caused a lesser villain than myself, A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself. Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain Be call'd Posthumus Leonatus; and Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen! My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen, Imogen, Imogen!\nImo.: Peace, my lord; hear, hear--\nPost.: Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page, There lie thy part.[Striking her: she falls.\nPis.: O, gentlemen, help! Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus! You ne'er kill'd Imogen till now. Help, help! Mine honor'd lady!\nCym.: Does the world go round?\nPost.: How come these staggers on me?\nPis.: Wake, my mistress!\nCym.: If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me To death with mortal joy.\nPis.: How fares my mistress?\nImo.: O, get thee from my sight; Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence! Breathe not where princes are.\nCym.: The tune of Imogen!\nPis.: Lady, The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if That box I gave you was not thought by me A precious thing: I had it from the queen.\nCym.: New matter still?\nImo.: It poison'd me.\nCor.: O gods! I left out one thing which the queen confess'd, Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection Which I gave him for cordial, she is served As I would serve a rat.'\nCym.: What's this, Cornelius?\nCor.: The queen, sir, very oft importuned me To temper poisons for her, still pretending The satisfaction of her knowledge only In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs, Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose Was of more danger, did compound for her A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease The present power of life, but in short time All offices of nature should again Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?\nImo.: Most like I did, for I was dead.\nBel.: My boys, There was our error.\nGui.: This is, sure, Fidele.\nImo.: Why did you throw your wedded lady from you? Think that you are upon a rock; and now Throw me again.[Embracing him.\nPost.: Hang there like fruit, my soul, Till the tree die!\nCym.: How now, my flesh, my child! What, makest thou me a dullard in this act? Wilt thou not speak to me?\nImo.: [[Kneeling]] Your blessing, sir.\nBel.: [[To Guiderius and Arviragus]] Though you did love this youth, I blame ye not; You had a motive for 't.\nCym.: My tears that fall Prove holy water on thee! Imogen, Thy mother's dead.\nImo.: I am sorry for 't, my lord.\nCym.: O, she was naught; and long of her it was That we meet here so strangely: but her son Is gone, we know not how nor where.\nPis.: My lord, Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten, Upon my lady's missing, came to me With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore, If I discover'd not which way she was gone, It was my instant death. By accident, I had a feigned letter of my master's Then in my pocket; which directed him To seek her on the mountains near to Milford; Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments, Which he enforced from me, away he posts With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate My lady's honor: what became of him I further know not.\nGui.: Let me end the story: I slew him there.\nCym.: Marry, the gods forfend! I would not thy good deeds should from my lips Pluck a hard sentence: prithee, valiant youth, Deny't again.\nGui.: I have spoke it, and I did it.\nCym.: He was a prince.\nGui.: A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me With language that would make me spurn the sea, If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head; And am right glad he is not standing here To tell this tale of mine.\nCym.: I am sorry for thee: By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must Endure our law: thou'rt dead.\nImo.: That headless man I thought had been my lord.\nCym.: Bind the offender, And take him from our presence.\nBel.: Stay, sir king: This man is better than the man he slew, As well descended as thyself; and hath More of thee merited than a band of Clotens Had ever scar for.[To the Guard]Let his arms alone; They were not born for bondage.\nCym.: Why, old soldier, Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for, By tasting of our wrath? How of descent As good as we?\nArv.: In that he spake too far.\nCym.: And thou shalt die for't.\nBel.: We will die all three: But I will prove that two on's are as good As I have given out him. My sons, I must, For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech, Though, haply, well for you.\nArv.: Your danger's ours.\nGui.: And our good his.\nBel.: Have at it then, by leave. Thou hadst, great king, a subject who Was call'd Belarius.\nCym.: What of him? he is A banish'd traitor.\nBel.: He it is that hath Assumed this age: indeed a banish'd man; I know not how a traitor.\nCym.: Take him hence: The whole world shall not save him.\nBel.: Not too hot: First pay me for the nursing of thy sons; And let it be confiscate all, so soon As I have received it.\nCym.: Nursing of my sons!\nBel.: I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee: Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons; Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir, These two young gentlemen, that call me father And think they are my sons, are none of mine; They are the issue of your loins, my liege, And blood of your begetting.\nCym.: How! my issue!\nBel.: So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan, Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd: Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes-- For such and so they are--these twenty years Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile, Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children Upon my banishment: I moved her to't, Having received the punishment before, For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty Excited me to treason: their dear loss, The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir, Here are your sons again; and I must lose Two of the sweet'st companions in the world. The benediction of these covering heavens Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy To inlay heaven with stars.\nCym.: Thou weep'st, and speak'st. The service that you three have done is more Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children: If these be they, I know not how to wish A pair of worthier sons.\nBel.: Be pleased awhile. This gentleman, whom I call Polydore, Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius: This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus, Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand Of his queen mother, which for more probation I can with ease produce.\nCym.: Guiderius had Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star; It was a mark of wonder.\nBel.: This is he; Who hath upon him still that natural stamp: It was wise nature's end in the donation, To be his evidence now.\nCym.: O, what, am I A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be, That, after this strange starting from your orbs, You may reign in them now! O Imogen, Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.\nImo.: No, my lord; I have got two worlds by't. O my gentle brothers, Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter But I am truest speaker: you call'd me brother, When I was but your sister; I you brothers, When ye were so indeed.\nCym.: Did you e'er meet?\nArv.: Ay, my good lord.\nGui.: And at first meeting loved; Continued so, until we thought he died.\nCor.: By the queen's dram she swallow'd.\nCym.: O rare instinct! When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgement Hath to it circumstantial branches, which Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived you? And when came you to serve our Roman captive? How parted with your brothers? how first met them? Why fled you from the court? and whither? These, And your three motives to the battle, with I know not how much more, should be demanded; And all the other by-dependencies, From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place Will serve our long inter'gatories. See, Posthumus anchors upon Imogen, And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting Each object with a joy: the counterchange Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground, And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.[To Belarius] Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.\nImo.: You are my father too, and did relieve me, To see this gracious season.\nCym.: All o'erjoy'd, Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too, For they shall taste our comfort.\nImo.: My good master, I will yet do you service.\nLuc.: Happy be you!\nCym.: The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought, He would have well becomed this place, and graced The thankings of a king.\nPost.: I am, sir, The soldier that did company these three In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he, Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might Have made you finish.\nIach.: [[Kneeling]] I am down again: But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee, As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you, Which I so often owe: but your ring first; And here the bracelet of the truest princess That ever swore her faith.\nPost.: Kneel not to me: The power that I have on you is to spare you; The malice towards you to forgive you: live, And deal with others better.\nCym.: Nobly doom'd! We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law; Pardon's the word to all.\nArv.: You holp us, sir, As you did mean indeed to be our brother; Joy'd are we that you are.\nPost.: Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome, Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd, Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found This label on my bosom; whose containing Is so from sense in hardness, that I can Make no collection of it: let him show His skill in the construction.\nLuc.: Philarmonus!\nSooth.: Here, my good lord.\nLuc.: Read, and declare the meaning.\nSooth.: [[Reads]] Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp; The fit and apt construction of thy name, Being Leo-natus, doth import so much.[To Cymbeline] The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter, Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer' We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine Is this most constant wife; who, even now, Answering the letter of the oracle, Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about With this most tender air.\nCym.: This hath some seeming.\nSooth.: The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline, Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n, For many years thought dead, are now revived, To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue Promises Britain peace and plenty.\nCym.: Well; My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius, Although the victor, we submit to Csar, And to the Roman empire; promising To pay our wonted tribute, from the which We were dissuaded by our wicked queen; Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers, Have laid most heavy hand.\nSooth.: The fingers of the powers above do tune The harmony of this peace. The vision Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle, From south to west on wing soaring aloft, Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle, The imperial Csar, should again unite His favor with the radiant Cymbeline, Which shines here in the west.\nCym.: Laud we the gods; And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our blest altars. Publish we this peace To all our subjects. Set we forward: let A Roman and a British ensign wave Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march: And in the temple of great Jupiter Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts. Set on there! Never was a war did cease, Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.Exeunt.",

    "content": "[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY.]\nCant.: My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged, Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd, But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question.\nEly.: But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?\nCant.: It must be thought on. If it pass against us, We lose the better half of our possession: For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the church Would they strip from us; being valued thus: As much as would maintain, to the king's honor, Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, Six thousand and two hundred good esquires; And, to relief of lazars and weak age, Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil, A hundred almshouses right well supplied; And to the coffers of the king beside, A thousand pounds of the year: thus runs the bill.\nEly.: This would drink deep.\nCant.: 'Twould drink the cup and all.\nEly.: But what prevention?\nCant.: The king is full of grace and fairregard.\nEly.: And a true lover of the holy church.\nCant.: The courses of his youth promised it not. The breath no sooner left his father's body, But that his wildness, mortified in him, Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment Consideration, like an angel, came And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him, Leaving his body as a paradise, To envelope and contain celestial spirits. Never was such a sudden scholar made; Never came reformation in a flood, With such a heady currance, scouring faults Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness So soon did lose his seat and all at once As in this king.\nEly.: We are blessed in the change.\nCant.: Hear him but reason in divinity, And all-admiring with an inward wish You would desire the king were made a prelate: Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs, You would say it hath been all in all his study: List his discourse of war, and you shall hear A fearful battle render'd you in music: Turn him to any cause of policy, The Gordian knot of it he will unloose, Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks, The air, a charter'd libertine, is still, And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears, To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences; So that the art and practic part of life Must be the mistress to this theoric: Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it, Since his addiction was to courses vain, His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow, His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports, And never noted in him any study, Any retirement, any sequestration From open haunts and popularity.\nEly.: The strawberry grows underneath the nettle And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best Neighbor'd by fruit of baser quality: And so the prince obscured his contemplation Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt, Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night, Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.\nCant.: It must be so; for miracles are ceased; And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected.\nEly.: But, my good lord, How now for mitigation of this bill Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty Incline to it, or not?\nCant.: He seems indifferent, Or rather swaying more upon our part Than cherishing the exbibiters against us; For I have made an offer to his majesty, Upon our spiritual convocation And in regard of causes now in hand, Which I have open'd to his grace at large, As touching France, to give a greater sum Than ever at one time the clergy yet Did to his predecessors part withal.\nEly.: How did this offer seem received, my lord?\nCant.: With good acceptance of his majesty; Save that there was not time enough to hear, As I perceived his grace would fain have done, The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms And generally to the crown and seat of France Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.\nEly.: What was the impediment that broke this off?\nCant.: The French ambassador upon that instant Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?\nEly.: It is.\nCant.: Then go we in, to know his embassy; Which I could with a ready guess declare, Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.\nEly.: I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.Exeunt.",

    "content": "[Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER,WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants.]\nK. Hen.: Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?\nExe.: Not here in presence.\nK. Hen.: Send for him, good uncle.\nWest.: Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?\nK. Hen.: Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved, Before we hear him, of some things of weight That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, andthe BISHOP OF ELY.\nCant.: God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it!\nK. Hen.: Sure, we thank you. My learned lord, we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salique that they have in France Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim: And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading, Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate, whose right Suits not in native colors with the truth; For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation Of what your reverence shall incite us to. Therefore take heed how you impawn our person, How you awake our sleeping sword of war: We charge you, in the name of God, take heed; For never two such kingdoms did contend Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops Are every one a woe, a sore complaint 'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords That make such waste in brief mortality. Under this conjuration, speak, my lord; For we will hear, note and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd As pure as sin with baptism.\nCant.: Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers, That owe yourselves, your lives and services To this imperial throne. There is no bar To make against your highness' claim to France But this, which they produce from Pharamond, 'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:' 'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:' Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze To be the realm of France, and Pharamond The founder of this law and female bar. Yet their own authors faithfully affirm That the land Salique is in Germany, Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe; Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons, There left behind and settled certain French; Who, holding in disdain the German women For some dishonest manners of their life, Establish'd then this law: to wit, no female Should be inheritrix in Salique land: Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala, Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen. Then doth it well appear that Salique law Was not devised for the realm of France: Nor did the French possess the Salique land Until four hundred one and twenty years After defunction of King Pharamond, Idly supposed the founder of this law; Who died within the year of our redemption Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French Beyond the river Sala, in the year Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say, King Pepin, which deposed Childeric, Did, as heir general, being descended Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair, Make claim and title to the crown of France. Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great, To find his title with some shows of truth, Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught, Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare, Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth, Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, Could not keep quiet in his conscience, Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother, Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine: By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was re-united to the crown of France. So that, as clear as is the summer's sun, King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim, King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear To hold in right and title of the female: So do the kings of France unto this day; Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law To bar your highness claiming from the female, And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.\nK. Hen.: May I with right and conscience make this claim?\nCant.: The sin upon my head, dread sovereign! For in the book of Numbers is it writ, When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord, Stand for you own; unwind your bloody flag; Look back into your mighty ancestors: Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb, From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit, And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince, Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy, Making defeat on the full power of France, Whiles his most mighty father on a hill Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp Forage in blood of French nobility. O noble English, that could entertain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by, All out of work and cold for action!\nEly.: Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats: You are their heir; you sit upon their throne; The blood and courage that renowned them Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege Is in the very May-morn of his youth, Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.\nExe.: Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth Do all expect that you should rouse yourself, As did the former lions of your blood.\nWest.: They know your grace hath cause and means and might; So hath your highness; never king of England Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects, Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.\nCant.: O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege, With blood and sword and fire to win your right; In aid whereof we of the spirituality Will raise your highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors.\nK. Hen.: We must not only arm to invade the French, But lay down our proportions to defend Against the Scot, who will make road upon us With all advantages.\nCant.: They of those marches, gracious sovereign, Shall be a wall sufficient to defend Our inland from the pilfering borderers.\nK. Hen.: We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, But fear the main intendment of the Scot, Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us; For you shall read that my great-grandfather Never went with his forces into France But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom Came pouring, like the tide into a breach, With ample and brim fulness of his force, Galling the gleaned land with hot assays, Girding with grievous siege castles and towns; That England, being empty of defence, Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighborhood.\nCant.: She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege; For hear her but exampled by herself: When all her chivalry hath been in France And she a mourning widow of her nobles, She hath herself not only well defended But taken and impounded as a stray The King of Scots; whom she did send to France, To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings And make her chronicle as rich with praise As is the ooze and bottom of the sea With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.\nWest.: But there's a saying very old and true, 'If that you will France win, Then with Scotland first begin:' For once the eagle England being in prey, To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs, Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, To tear and havoc more than she can eat.\nExe.: It follows then the cat must stay at home: Yet that is but a crush'd necessity, Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries, And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves. While that the armed hand doth fight abroad, The advised head defends itself at home; For government, though high and low and lower, Put into parts, doth keep in one consent, Congreeing in a full and natural close, Like music.\nCant.: Therefore doth heaven divide The state of man in divers functions, Setting endeavour in continual motion; To which is fixed, as an aim or butt, Obedience: for so work the honey-bees, Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom. They have a king and officers of sorts; Where some, like magistrates, correct at home, Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad, Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings, Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds, Which pillage they with merry march bring home To the tent-royal of their emperor; Who, busied in his majesty, surveys The singing masons building roofs of gold, The civil citizens kneading up the honey, The poor mechanic porters crowding in Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate, The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum, Delivering o'er to executors pale The lazy yawning drone. I this infer, That many things, having full reference To one consent, may work contrariously: As many arrows, loosed several ways, Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town; As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea; As many lines close in the dial's centre; So may a thousand actions, once afoot, End in one purpose, and be all well borne Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege. Divide your happy England into four; Whereof take you one quarter into France, And you withal shall make all Gallia shake. If we, with thrice such powers left at home, Cannot defend our own doors from the dog, Let us be worried and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy.\nK. Hen.: Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.Exeunt some Attendants. Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help, And yours, the noble sinews of our power, France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe, Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit, Ruling in large and ample empery O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms, Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn, Tombless, with no remembrance over them: Either our history shall with full mouth Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave, Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth, Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.Enter Ambassadors of France. Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear Your greeting is from him, not from the king.\nFirst Amb.: May't please your majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge; Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?\nK. Hen.: We are no tyrant, but a Christian king; Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons: Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin's mind.\nFirst Amb.: Thus, then, in few. Your highness, lately sending into France, Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third. In answer of which claim, the prince our master Says that you savor too much of your youth, And bids you be advised there's nought in France That can be with a nimble galliard won; You cannot revel into dukedoms there. He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit, This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this, Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.\nK. Hen.: What treasure, uncle?\nExe.: Tennis-balls, my liege.\nK. Hen.: We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us; His present and your pains we thank you for: When we have march'd our rackets to these balls, We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard. Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler That all the courts of France will be disturb'd With chaces. And we understand him well, How he comes o'er us with our wilder days, Not measuring what use we made of them. We never valued this poor seat of England; And therefore, living hence, did give ourself To barbarous license; as 'tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home. But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state, Be like a king and show my sail of greatness When I do rouse me in my throne of France: For that I have laid by my majesty And plodded like a man for working-days, But I will rise there with so full a glory That I will dazzle all the eyes of France, Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us. And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands; Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down; And some are yet ungotten and unborn That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn. But this lies all within the will of God, To whom I do appeal; and in whose name Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on, To venge me as I may and to put forth My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause. So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin His jest will savor but of shallow wit, When thousands weep more than did laugh at it. Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.[Exeunt Ambassadors.\nExe.: This was a merry message.\nK. Hen.: We hope to make the sender blush at it. Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour That may give furtherance to our expedition; For we have now no thought in us but France, Save those to God, that run before our business. Therefore let our proportions for these wars Be soon collected and all things thought upon That may with reasonable swiftness add More feathers to our wings; for, God before, We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door. Therefore let every man now task his thought, That this fair action may on foot be brought.Exeunt.Flourish.",

For now sits Expectation in the air, And hides a sword from hilts unto the point With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets, Promised to Harry and his followers. The French, advised by good intelligence Of this most dreadful preparation, Shake in their fear and with pale policy Seek to divert the English purposes. O England! model to thy inward greatness, Like little body with a mighty heart, What mightst thou do, that honor would thee do, Were all thy children kind and natural! But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men, One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second, Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, Have, for the gilt of France--O guilt indeed!-- Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France; And by their hands this grace of kings must die, If hell and treason hold their promises, Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton. Linger your patience on; and we'll digest The abuse of distance; force a play: The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed; The king is set from London; and the scene Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton; There is the playhouse now, there must you sit: And thence to France shall we convey you safe, And bring you back, charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass; for, if we may, We'll not offend one stomach with our play.

We'll yet enlarge that man, Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care And tender preservation of our person, Would have him punish'd. And now to our French causes: Who are the late commissioners?\nCam.: I one, my lord: Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.\nScroop.: So did you me, my liege.\nGrey.: And I, my royal sovereign.\nK. Hen.: Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours; There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight, Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours: Read them; and know, I know your worthiness. My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter, We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen! What see you in those papers that you lose So much complexion? Look ye, how they change! Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there, That hath so cowarded and chased your blood Out of appearance?\nCam.: I do confess my fault; And do submit me to your highness' mercy.\nGrey. Scroop.: To which we all appeal.\nK. Hen.: The mercy that was quick in us but late, By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd: You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy; For your own reasons turn into your bosoms, As dogs upon their masters, worrying you. See you, my princes and my noble peers, These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here, You know how apt our love was to accord To furnish him with all appertinents Belonging to his honor; and this man Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired, And sworn unto the practices of France, To kill us here in Hampton: to the which This knight, no less for bounty bound to us Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O, What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel, Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature! Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels, That knew'st the very bottom of my soul, That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold, Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use! May it be possible, that foreign hire Could out of thee extract one spark of evil That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange, That, though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it. Treason and murder ever kept together, As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose, Working so grossly in a natural cause, That admiration did not whoop at them: But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in Wonder to wait on treason and on murder: And whatsoever cunning fiend it was That wrought upon thee so preposterously Hath got the voice in hell for excellence: All other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches, colors, and with forms being fetch'd From glistering semblance of piety; But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up, Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason, Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor. If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus Should with his lion gait walk the whole world, He might return to vasty Tartar back, And tell the legions 'I can never win A soul so easy as that Englishman's.' O, how hast thou with jealousy infected The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful? Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned? Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family? Why, so didst thou: seem they religious? Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet, Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger, Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood, Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement, Not working with the eye without the ear, And but in purged judgement trusting neither? Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem: And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot, To mark the full-fraught man and best indued With some suspicion. I will weep for thee; For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like Another fall of man. Their faults are open: Arrest them to the answer of the law; And God acquit them of their practices!\nScroop.: Our purposes God justly hath discover'd And I repent my fault more than my death; Which I beseech your highness to forgive, Although my body pay the price of it.\nCam.: For me, the gold of France did not seduce; Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended: But God be thanked for prevention; Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice, Beseeching God and you to pardon me.\nGrey.: Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself. Prevented from a damned enterprise: My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.\nK. Hen.: God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence. You have conspired against our royal person, Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers Received the golden earnest of our death; Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter, His princes and his peers to servitude, His subjects to oppression and contempt And his whole kingdom into desolation. Touching our person seek we no revenge; But we our kingdom's safety must so tender, Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence, Poor miserable wretches, to your death: The taste whereof, God of his mercy give You patience to endure, and true repentance Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.[Exeunt Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, guarded Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof Shall be to you, as us, like glorious. We doubt not of a fair and lucky war, Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now But every rub is smoothed on our way. Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver Our puissance into the hand of God, Putting it straight in expedition. Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance: No king of England, if not king of France.[Exeunt.",

King.: Thus comes the English with full power upon us; And more than carefully it us concerns To answer royally in our defences. Therefore the Dukes of Berri and Bretagne, Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth, And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch, To line and new repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant; For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf. It fits us then to be as provident As fear may teach us out of late examples Left by the fatal and neglected English Upon our fields.\nDau.: My most redoubted father, It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe; For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom, Though war nor no known quarrel were in question, But that defences, musters, preparations, Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected, As were a war in expectation. Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth To view the sick and feeble parts of France: And let us do it with no show of fear; No, with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance: For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd, Her sceptre so fantastically borne By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth, That fear attends her not.\nCon.: O peace, Prince Dauphin! You are too much mistaken in this king: Question your grace the late ambassadors, With what great state he heard their embassy, How well supplied with noble counsellors, How modest in exception, and withal How terrible in constant resolution, And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus, Covering discretion with a coat of folly; As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first appear and be most delicate.\nDau.: Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable; But though we think it so, it is no matter: In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems: So the proportions of defence are fill'd; Which of a weak and niggardly projection Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting A little cloth.\nFr. King.: Think we King Harry strong; And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him. The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us; And he is bred out of that bloody strain That haunted us in our familiar paths: Witness our too much memorable shame When Cressy battle fatally was struck, And all our princes captived by the hand Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales; Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing, Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun, Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him, Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made.

That you may know 'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim, Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days, Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked, He sends you this most memorable line, In every branch truly demonstrative; Willing you overlook this pedigree: And when you find him evenly derived From his most famed of famous ancestors, Edward the Third, he bids you then resign Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held From him the native and true challenger.\nFr. King.: Or else what follows?\nExe.: Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it: Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming, In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove, That, if requiring fail, he will compel; And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord, Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy On the poor souls for whom this hungry war Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries, The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans, For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers, That shall be swallow'd in this controversy. This is his claim, his threatening, and my message; Unless the Dauphin be in presence here, To whom expressly I bring greeting too.\nFr. King.: For us, we will consider of this further: To-morrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother England.\nDau.: For the Dauphin, I stand here for him: what to him from England?\nExe.: Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt, And any thing that may not misbecome The mighty sender, doth he prize you at. Thus says my king; an if your father's highness Do not, in grant of all demands at large, Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty, He'll call you to so hot an answer of it, That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordnance.\nDau.: Say, if my father render fair return, It is against my will; for I desire Nothing but odds with England: to that end, As matching to his youth and vanity, I did present him with the Paris balls.\nExe.: He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it, Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe: And, be assured, you'll find a difference, As we his subjects have in wonder found, Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now: now he weighs time Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read In your own losses, if he stay in France.\nFr. King.: To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.\nExe.: Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay; For he is footed in this land already.\nFr.

Mort de ma vie! if they march along Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom, To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.\nCon.: Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle? Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull, On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale, Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water, A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barleybroth, Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat? And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine, Seem frosty? O, for honor of our land, Let us not hang like roping icicles Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields! Poor we may call them in their native lords,\nDau.: By faith and honor, Our madams mock at us, and plainly say Our mettle is bred out and they will give Their bodies to the lust of English youth To new-store France with bastard warriors.\nBour.: They bid us to the English dancingschools, And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos; Saying our grace is only in our heels, And that we are most lofty runaways.\nFr. King.: Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence: Let him greet England with our sharp defiance. Up, princes! and, with spirit of honor edged More sharper than your swords, hie to the field: Charles Delabreth, high constable of France; You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri, Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont, Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg, Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois; High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights, For your great seats now quit you of great shames. Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur: Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon: Go down upon him, you have power enough, And in a captive chariot into Rouen Bring him our prisoner.\nCon.: This becomes the great. Sorry am I his numbers are so few, His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march, For I am sure, when he shall see our army, He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear And for achievement offer us his ransom.\nFr. King.: Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy, And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give. Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.\nDau.: Not so, I do beseech your majesty.\nFr. King.: Be patient, for you shall remain with us. Now forth, lord constable and princes all, And quickly bring us word of England's fall.[Exeunt.",

Yet, forgive me, God, That I do brag thus! This your air of France Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.

From camp to camp through the foul womb of night The hum of either army stilly sounds, That the fix'd sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other's watch: Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames Each battle sees the other's umber'd face; Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents The armorers, accomplishing the knights, With busy hammers closing rivets up, Give dreadful note of preparation: The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll, And the third hour of drowsy morning name. Proud of their numbers and secure in soul, The confident and over-lusty French Do the low-rated English play at dice; And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp So tediously away. The poor condemned English, Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires Sit patiently and inly ruminate The morning's danger, and their gesture sad Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats Presenteth them unto the gazing moon So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold The royal captain of this ruin'd band Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent, Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!' For forth he goes and visits all his host, Bids them good morrow with a modest smile And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen. Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him; Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color Unto the weary and all-watched night, But freshly looks and over-bears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty; That every wretch, pining and pale before, Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks: A largess universal like the sun His liberal eye doth give to every one, Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all Behold, as may unworthiness define, A little touch of Harry in the night. And so our scene must to the battle fly; Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace With four or five most vile and ragged foils, Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous, The name of Agincourt.

There is some soul of goodness in things evil, Would men observingly distil it out. For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers, Which is both healthful and good husbandry: Besides, they are our outward consciences, And preachers to us all, admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end.

And what have kings, that privates have not too, Save ceremony, save general ceremony? And what art thou, thou idol ceremony? What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers? What are thy rents? what are thy comings in? O ceremony, show me but thy worth! What is thy soul of adoration? Art thou aught else but place, degree and form, Creating awe and fear in other men? Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd Than they in fearing. What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet, But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness, And bid thy ceremony give thee cure! Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation? Will it give place to flexure and low bending? Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee, Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream, That play'st so subtly with a king's repose; I am a king that find thee, and I know 'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball, The sword, the mace, the crown imperial, The intertissued robe of gold and pearl, The farced title running 'fore the king, The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp That beats upon the high shore of this world, No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony, Not all these, laid in bed majestical, Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave, Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread; Never sees horrid night, the child of hell, But, like a lackey, from the rise to set Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn, Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse, And follows so the ever-running year, With profitable labor, to his grave: And, but for ceremony, such a wretch, Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king. The slave, a member of the country's peace, Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace, Whose hours the peasant best advantages.Re-enter ERPINGHAM.\nErp.: My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, Seek through your camp to find you.\nK.

I Richard's body have interred anew; And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears Than from it issued forced drops of blood: Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay, Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up Toward heaven, to pardon blood;and I have built Two chantries,where the sad and solemn priests Sing stillfor Richard's soul. More will I do; Though all that I can do is nothing worth, Since that my penitence comes after all, Imploring pardon.Re-enter GLOUCESTER.\nGlou.: My liege!\nK. Hen.: My brother Gloucester's voice?

'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords, That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants, Who in unnecessary action swarm About our squares of battle, were enow To purge this field of such a hilding foe, Though we upon this mountain's basis by Took stand for idle speculation: But that our honors must not.

Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus? The man that once did sell the lion's skin. While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him. A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves; upon the which, I trust, Shall witness live in brass of this day's work: And those that leave their valiant bones in France, Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills, They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them, And draw their honors reeking up to heaven; Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime, The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France. Mark then abounding valor in our English, That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing, Break out into a second course of mischief, Killing in relapse of mortality.

Hen.: My lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester, Follow Fluellen closely at the heels: The glove which I have given him for a favor May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear; It is the soldier's; I by bargain should Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick: If that the soldier strike him, as I judge By his blunt bearing he will keep his word, Some sudden mischief may arise of it; For I do know Fluellen valiant And, touch'd with choler, hot as gunpowder, And quickly will return an injury: Follow, and see there be no harm between them.

Hen.: This note doth tell me of ten thousand French That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number, And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead One hundred twenty six: added to these, Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen, Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which, Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights: So that, in these ten thousand they have lost, There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries; The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires, And gentlemen of blood and quality.

Now we bear the king Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen, Heave him away upon your winged thoughts Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys, Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deepmouth'd sea, Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king Seems to prepare his way: so let him land, And solemnly see him set on to London. So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath; Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruised helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city: he forbids it, Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride; Giving full trophy, signal and ostent Quite from himself to God. But now behold, In the quick forge and working-house of thought, How London doth pour out her citizens! The mayor and all his brethren in best sort, Like to the senators of the antique Rome, With the plebeians swarming at their heels, Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in: As by a lower but loving likelihood, Were now the general of our gracious empress, As in good time, he may, from Ireland coming, Bringing rebellion broached on his sword, How many would the peaceful city quit, To welcome him! much more, and much more cause, Did they this Harry. Now in London place him; As yet the lamentation of the French Invites the King of England's stay at home; The emperor's coming in behalf of France, To order peace between them; and omit All the occurrences, whatever chanced. Till Harry's back-return again to France: There must we bring him; and myself have play'd The interim, by remembering you 'tis past. Then brook abridgement, and your eyes advance, After your thoughts, straight back again to France.[Exit.",

Hen.: Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met! Unto our brother France, and to our sister, Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishes To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine; And, as a branch and member of this royalty, By whom this great assembly is contrived, We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy; And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!\nFr. King.: Right joyous are we to behold your face, Most worthy brother England; fairly met: So are you, princes English, every one.\nQ. Isa.: So happy be the issue, brother England, Of this good day and of this gracious meeting, As we are now glad to behold your eyes; Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them Against the French, that met them in their bent, The fatal balls of murdering basilisks: The venom of such looks, we fairly hope, Have lost their quality, and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.\nK. Hen.: To cry amen to that, thus we appear.\nQ. Isa.: You English princes all, I do salute you.\nBur.: My duty to you both, on equal love, Great Kings of France and England! That I have labor'd, With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours, To bring your most imperial majesties Unto this bar and royal interview, Your mightiness on both parts best can witness. Since then my office hath so far prevail'd That, face to face and royal eye to eye, You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me, If I demand, before this royal view, What rub or what impediment there is, Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace, Dear nurse of arts, plenties and joyful births, Should not in this best garden of the world Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage? Alas, she hath from France too long been chased, And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps, Corrupting in it own fertility. Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart, Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd, Like prisoners wildly over-grown with hair, Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery; The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover, Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank, Conceives by idleness and nothing teems But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs, Losing both beauty and utility. And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges, Defective in their natures, grow to wildness, Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost, or do not learn for want of time, The sciences that should become our country; But grow like savages,--as soldiers will That nothing do but meditate on blood,-- To swearing and stern looks, defused attire And every thing that seems unnatural. Which to reduce into our former favour You are assembled: and my speech entreats That I may know the let, why gentle Peace Should not expel these inconveniences And bless us with her former qualities.\nK. Hen.: If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace, Whose want gives growth to the imperfections Which you have cited, you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands; Whose tenours and particular effects You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.\nBur.: The king hath heard them; to the which as yet There is no answer made.\nK. Hen.: Well then the peace, Which you before so urged,lies in his answer.\nFr. King.: I have but with a cursorary eye O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more, with better heed To re-survey them, we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer.\nK. Hen.: Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter, And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester, Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king; And take with you free power to ratify, Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best Shall see advantageable for our dignity, Any thing in or out of our demands, And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister, Go with the princes, or stay here with us?\nQ. Isa.: Our gracious brother, I will go with them: Haply a woman's voice may do some good, When articles too nicely urged be stood on.\nK. Hen.: Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us: She is our capital demand, comprised Within the fore-rank of our articles.\nQ. Isa.: She hath good leave.Exeunt all except Henry, Katharine, and Alice.\nK. Hen.: Fair Katharine, and most fair, Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter to a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?\nK. Hen.: English tongue. Do youlike me, Kate?\nK. Hen.: Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall pleasehim, Kate.\nKath.: Den it sail also content me.\nK. Hen.: Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you myqueen.\nWest.: The king hath granted every article: His daughter first, and then in sequel all, According to their firm proposed natures.\nFr. King.: Nor this I have not, brother, so denied, But your request shall make me let it pass.\nK. Hen.: I pray you then, in love and dear alliance, Let that one article rank with the rest; And thereupon give me your daughter.\nFr. King.: Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms Of France and England, whose very shores look pale With envy of each other's happiness, May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.\nK. Hen.: Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all, That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.[Flourish.\nQ. Isa.: God, the best maker of all marriages, Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one! As man and wife, being two, are one in love, So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal, That never may ill office, or fell jealousy, Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage, Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms, To make divorce of their incorporate league; That English may as French, French Englishmen, Receive each other. God speak this Amen!\nK. Hen.: Prepare we for our marriage: on which day, My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath, And all the peers', for surety of our leagues. Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me; And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be![Sennet. Exeunt.",

    "content": "[London.  An ante-chamber in the palace.]\n[Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK at one door; at the other,the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM and the LORDABERGAVENNY.]\nBuck.: Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done Since last we saw in France?\nNor.: I thank your grace, Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer Of what I saw there.\nBuck.: An untimely ague Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when Those suns of glory, those two lights of men, Met in the vale of Andren.\nNor.: 'Twixt Guynes and Arde: I was then present, saw them salute on horseback; Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung In their embracement, as they grew together; Which had they,what four throned ones could have weigh'd Such a compounded one?\nBuck.: All the whole time I was my chamber's prisoner.\nNor.: Then you lost The view of earthly glory: men might say, Till this time pomp was single, but now married To one above itself. Each following day Became the next day's master, till the last Made former wonders its. To-day the French, All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods, Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they Made Britain India: every man that stood Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were As cherubins, all gilt: the madams too, Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear The pride upon them, that their very labour Was to them as a painting: now this masque Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings, Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst, As presence did present them; him in eye, Still him in praise: and, being present both, Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns-- For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged The noble spirits to arms, they did perform Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story, Being now seen possible enough, got credit, That Bevis was believed.\nBuck.: O, you go far.\nNor.: As I belong to worship and affect In honour honesty, the tract of every thing Would by a good discourser lose some life, Which action's self was tongue to.All was royal; To the disposing of it nought rebell'd, Order gave each thing view; the office did Distinctly his full function.\nBuck.: Who did guide, I mean, who set the body and the limbs Of this great sport together,as you guess?\nNor.: One, certes, that promises no element In such a business.\nBuck.: I pray you, who, my lord?\nNor.: All this was order'd by the good discretion Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.\nBuck.: The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed From his ambitious finger. What had he To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder That such a keech can with his very bulk Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun And keep it from the earth.\nNor.: Surely, sir, There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends; For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon For high feats done to the crown; neither allied To eminent assistants; but, spider-like, Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note, The force of his own merit makes his way; A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys A place next to the king.\nAber.: I cannot tell What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye Pierce into that; but I can see his pride Peep through each part of him: whence has he that, If not from hell? the devil is a niggard, Or has given all before, and he begins A new hell in himself.\nBuck.: Why the devil, Upon this French going out, took he upon him, Without the privity o' the king, to appoint Who should attend on him? He makes up the file Of all the gentry; for the most part such To whom as great a charge as little honour He meant to lay upon: and his own letter, The honourable board of council out, Must fetch him in the papers.\nAber.: I do know Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have By this so sicken'd their estates, that never They shall abound as formerly.\nBuck.: O, many Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em For this great journey. What did this vanity But minister communication of A most poor issue?\nNor.: Grievingly I think, The peace between the French and us not values The cost that did conclude it.\nBuck.: Every man, After the hideous storm that follow'd, was A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke Into a general prophecy; That this tempest, Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded The sudden breach on't.\nNor.: Which is budded out; For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.\nAber.: Is it therefore The ambassador is silenced?\nNor.: Marry, is't.\nAber.: A proper title of a peace; and purchased At a superfluous rate!\nBuck.: Why, all this business Our reverend cardinal carried.\nNor.: Like it your grace, The state takes notice of the private difference Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you-- And take it from a heart that wishes towards you Honour and plenteous safety--that you read The cardinal's malice and his potency Together; to consider further that What his high hatred would effect wants not A minister in his power. You know his nature, That he's revengeful, and I know his sword Math a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said, It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend, Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel, You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock That I advise your shunning.Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him, certainof the Guard, and two Secretaries with papers. TheCARDINAL in his passage fixeth his eye on BUCKINGHAM,and BUCKINGHAM on him,both full of disdain.\nWol.: The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha? Where's his examination?\nFirst Secr.: Here, so please you.\nWol.: Is he in person ready?\nFirst Secr.: Ay, please your grace.\nWol.: Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham Shall lessen this big look.Exeunt Wolsey and his Train.\nBuck.: This butcher's cur is venommouth'd, and I Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book Outworths a noble's blood.\nNor.: What, are you chafed? Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only Which your disease requires.\nBuck.: I read in's looks Matter against me; and his eye reviled Me, as his abject object: at this instant He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king; I'll follow and outstare him.\nNor.: Stay, my lord, And let your reason with your choler question What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills Requires slow pace at first: anger is like A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way, Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England Can advise me like you: be to yourself As you would to your friend.\nBuck.: I'll to the king; And from a mouth of honour quite cry down This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim There's difference in no persons.\nNor.: Be advised; Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot That it do singe yourself: we may outrun, By violent swiftness, that which we run at, And lose by over-running. Know you not, That fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er, In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised: I say again, there is no English soul More stronger to direct you than yourself, If with the sap of reason you would quench, Or but allay, the fire of passion.\nBuck.: Sir, I am thankful to you; and I'll go along By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow, Whom from the flow of gall I name not but From sincere motions, by intelligence, And proofs as clear as founts in July when We see each grain of gravel, I do know To be corrupt and treasonous.\nNor.: Say not 'treasonous.'\nBuck.: To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox, Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief As able to perform't; his mind and place Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally-- Only to show his pomp as well in France As here at home, suggests the king our master To this last costly treaty, the interview That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass Did break i' the rinsing.\nNor.: Faith, and so it did.\nBuck.: Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal The articles o' the combination drew As himself pleased; and they were ratified As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end As give a crutch to the dead: but our countcardinal Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey, Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,-- Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor, Under pretence to see the queen his aunt,-- For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation: His fears were, that the interview betwixt England and France might, through their amity, Breed him some prejudice; for from this league Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,-- Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made, And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired, That he would please to alter the king's course, And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know, As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases, And for his own advantage.\nNor.: I am sorry To hear this of him; and could wish he were Something mistaken in't.\nBuck.: No, not a syllable: I do pronounce him in that very shape He shall appear in proof.Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-Arms before him, andtwo or three of the Guard.\nBran.: Your office, sergeant; execute it.\nSerg.: Sir, My lord the Duke of Buckingham and Earl Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I Arrest thee of high treason in the name Of our most sovereign king.\nBuck.: Lo, you, my lord, The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish Under device and practice.\nBran.: I am sorry To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure You shall to the Tower.\nBuck.: It will help me nothing To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me, Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven Be done in this and all things! I obey. O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!\nBran.: Nay, he must bear you company. The king[To Abergavenny. Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know How he determines further.\nAber.: As the duke said, The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure By me obey'd!\nBran.: Here is a warrant from The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car, One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor,--\nBuck.: So, so; These are the limbs o' the pot: no more, I hope.\nBran.: A monk o' the Chartreux.\nBuck.: O, Nicholas Hopkins?\nBran.: He.\nBuck.: My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already: I am the shadow of poor Buckingham, Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on, By darkening my clear sun.

That you would love yourself, and in that love Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor The dignity of your office, is the point Of my petition.\nKing.: Lady mine, proceed.\nQ. Kath.: I am solicited, not by a few, And those of true condition, that your subjects Are in great grievance: there have been commissions Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart Of all their loyalties: wherein, although, My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches Most bitterly on you, as putter on Of these exactions, yet the king our master-- Whose honour heaven shield from soil!-even he escapes not Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks The sides of loyalty, and almost appears In loud rebellion.\nNor.: Not almost appears, It doth appear; for, upon these taxations, The clothiers all, not able to maintain The many to them 'longing, have put off The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who, Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger And lack of other means, in desperate manner Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar, And danger serves among them.\nKing.: Taxation! Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal, You that are blamed for it alike with us, Know you of this taxation?\nWol.: Please you, sir, I know but of a single part, in aught Pertains to the state; and front but in that file Where others tell steps with me.\nQ. Kath.: No, my lord, You know no more than others; but you frame Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome To those which would not know them, and yet must Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions, Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are Most pestilent to the hearing; and, to bear em, The back is sacrifice to the load. They say They are devised by you; or else you suffer Too hard an exclamation.\nKing.: Still exaction! The nature of it? in what kind, let's know, Is this exaction?\nQ. Kath.: I am much too venturous In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief Comes through commissions, which compel from each The sixth part of his substance, to be levied Without delay; and the pretence for this Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths: Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze Allegiance in them; their curses now Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass, This tractable obedience is a slave To each incensed will. I would your highness Would give it quick consideration, for There is no primer business.\nKing.: By my life, This is against our pleasure.\nWol.: And for me, I have no further gone in this than by A single voice; and that not pass'd me but By learned approbation of the judges. If I am Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know My faculties nor person, yet will be The chronicles of my doing, let me say 'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake That virtue must go through. We must not stint Our necessary actions, in the fear To cope malicious censurers; which ever, As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further Than vainly longing. What we oft do best, By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft, Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up For our best act. If we shall stand still, In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at, We should take root here where we sit, or sit State-statues only.\nKing.: Things done well, And with a care, exempt themselves from fear; Things done without example, in their issue Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent Of this commission? I believe, not any. We must not rend our subjects from our laws, And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each? A trembling contribution! Why, we take From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber; And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd, The air will drink the sap. To every county Where this is question'd send our letters, with Free pardon to each man that has denied The force of this commission: pray, look to't; I put it to your care.\nWol.: A word with you.[To the Secretary.

Yet see, When these so noble benefits shall prove Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt, They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly Than ever they were fair. This man so complete, Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we, Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady, Hath into monstrous habits put the graces That once were his, and is become as black As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear-- This was his gentleman in trust--of him Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount The fore-recited practices; whereof We cannot feel too little, hear too much.\nWol.: Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you, Most like a careful subject, have collected Out of the Duke of Buckingham.\nKing.: Speak freely.\nSurv.: First, it was usual with him, every day It would infect his speech, that if the king Should without issue die, he'll carry it so To make the sceptre his: these very words I've heard him utter to his son-in-law, Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced Revenge upon the cardinal.\nWol.: Please your highness, note This dangerous conception in this point. Not friended by his wish, to your high person His will is most malignant; and it stretches Beyond you, to your friends.\nQ. Kath.: My learn'd lord cardinal, Deliver all with charity.\nKing.: Speak on: How grounded he his title to the crown, Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him At any time speak aught?\nSurv.: He was brought to this By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.\nKing.: What was that Hopkins?\nSurv.: Sir, a Chartreux friar, His confessor; who fed him every minute With words of sovereignty.\nKing.: How know'st thou this?\nSurv.: Not long before your highness sped to France, The duke being at the Rose, within the parish Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand What was the speech among the Londoners Concerning the French journey: I replied, Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious, To the king's danger. Presently the duke Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted 'Twould prove the verity of certain words Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he, 'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour To hear from him a matter of some moment: Whom after under the confession's seal He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke My chaplain to no creature living, but To me, should utter, with demure confidence This pausingly ensued: Neither the king nor's heirs, Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke Shall govern England.'\nQ. Kath.: If I know you well, You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed You charge not in your spleen a noble person And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed; Yes, heartily beseech you.\nKing.: Let him on. Go forward.\nSurv.: On my soul, I'll speak but truth. I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him To ruminate on this so far, until It forged him some design, which, being believed, It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush, It can do me no damage;' adding further, That had the king in his last sickness fail'd, The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads Should have gone off.\nKing.: Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha! There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?\nSurv.: I can, my liege.\nKing.: Proceed.\nSurv.: Being at Greenwich, After your highness had reproved the duke About Sir William Blomer,--\nKing.: I remember Of such a time: being my sworn servant, The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?\nSurv.: 'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed, As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd The part my father meant to act upon The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury, Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted, As he made semblance of his duty, would Have put his knife into him.'\nKing.: A giant traitor!\nWol.: Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom, And this man out of prison?\nQ. Kath.: God mend all!\nKing.: There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?\nSurv.: After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,' He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger, Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes, He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenour Was,--were he evil used, he would outgo His father by as much as a performance Does an irresolute purpose.\nKing.: There's his period, To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd; Call him to present trial: if he may Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none, Let him not seek 't of us: by day and night, He's traitor to the height.Exeunt.",

    "content": "[Westminster.  A street.]\n[Enter two Gentlemen, meeting.]\nFirst Gent.: Whither away so fast?\nSec. Gent.: O, God save ye! Even to the hall, to hear what shall become Of the great Duke of Buckingham.\nFirst Gent.: I'll save you That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony Of bringing back the prisoner.\nSec. Gent.: Were you there?\nFirst Gent.: Yes, indeed, was I.\nSec. Gent.: Pray, speak what has happen'd.\nFirst Gent.: You may guess quickly what.\nSec. Gent.: Is he found guilty?\nFirst Gent.: Yes, truly is he,and condemn'd upon 't.\nSec. Gent.: I am sorry for't.\nFirst Gent.: So are a number more.\nSec. Gent.: But, pray, how pass'd it?\nFirst Gent.: I'll tell you in a little. The great duke Came to the bar; where to his accusations He pleaded still not guilty and alleged Many sharp reasons to defeat the law. The king's attorney on the contrary Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired To have brought viva voce to his face: At which appear'd against him his surveyor; Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car, Confessor to him; with that devil-monk, Hopkins that made this mischief.\nSec. Gent.: That was he That fed him with his prophecies?\nFirst Gent.: The same. All these accused him strongly; which he fain Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not: And so his peers, upon this evidence, Have found him guilty of high treason. Much He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all Was either pitied in him or forgotten.\nSec. Gent.: After all this, how did he bear himself?\nFirst Gent.: When he was brought again to the bar, to hear His knell rung out, his judgement, he was stirr'd With such an agony, he sweat extremely, And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty: But he fell to himself again, and sweetly In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.\nSec. Gent.: I do not think he fears death.\nFirst Gent.: Sure, he does not-- He never was so womanish; the cause He may a little grieve at.\nSec. Gent.: Certainly The cardinal is the end of this.\nFirst Gent.: 'Tis likely, By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder, Then deputy of Ireland; who removed, Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too, Lest he should help his father.\nSec. Gent.: That trick of state Was a deep envious one.\nFirst Gent.: At his return No doubt he will requite it. This is noted, And generally, whoever the king favours, The cardinal instantly will find employment, And far enough from court too.\nSec. Gent.: All the commons Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience, Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham, The mirror of all courtesy;--\nFirst Gent.: Stay there, sir, And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tipstaves before him; the axe with the edge towards him; halberds on each side: ac- companied with SIR THOMAS LOVELL, SIR NICHOLAS VAUX, SIR WILLIAM SANDS, and common people.\nSec. Gent.: Let's stand close, and behold him.\nBuck.: All good people, You that thus far have come to pity me, Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me. I have this day received a traitor's judgement, And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness, And if I have a conscience, let it sink me, Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful! The law I bear no malice for my death; 'T has done, upon the premises, but justice: But those that sought it I could wish more Christians: Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em: Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief, Nor build their evils on the graves of great men; For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em. For further life in this world I ne'er hope, Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies More than I dare make faults.You few that loved me, And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham, His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave Is only bitter to him, only dying, Go with me, like good angels, to my end; And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me, Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice, And lift my soul to heaven.Lead on, o' God's name.\nLov.: I do beseech your grace, for charity, If ever any malice in your heart Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.\nBuck.: Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you As I would be forgiven: I forgive all; There cannot be those numberless offences 'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:no black envy Shall mark my grave.Commend me to his grace; And, if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake, Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live Longer than I have time to tell his years! Ever beloved and loving may his rule be! And when old time shall lead him to his end, Goodness and he fill up one monument!\nLov.: To the water side I must conduct your grace; Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux, Who undertakes you to your end.\nVaux.: Prepare there, The duke is coming: see the barge be ready; And fit it with such furniture as suits The greatness of his person.\nBuck.: Nay, Sir Nicholas, Let it alone; my state now will but mock me. When I came hither, I was lord high constable And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun: Yet I am richer than my base accusers, That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it; And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for 't. My noble father, Henry of Buckingham, Who first raised head against usurping Richard, Flying for succour to his servant Banister, Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd, And without trial fell; God's peace be with him! Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying My father's loss, like a most royal prince, Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins, Made my name once more noble. Now his son, Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all That made me happy at one stroke has taken For ever from the world. I had my trial, And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me A little happier than my wretched father: Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most; A most unnatural and faithless service! Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me, This from a dying man receive as certain: Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends And give your hearts to, when they once perceive The least rub in your fortunes, fall away Like water from ye, never found again But where they mean to sink ye. All good people, Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell: And when you would say something that is sad, Speak how I fell.I have done; and God forgive me!Exeunt Duke and Train.\nFirst Gent.: O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls, I fear, too many curses on their heads That were the authors.\nSec. Gent.: If the duke be guiltless, 'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling Of an ensuing evil, if it fall, Greater than this.\nFirst Gent.: Good angels keep it from us! What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?\nSec. Gent.: This secret is so weighty, 'twill require A strong faith to conceal it.\nFirst Gent.: Let me have it; I do not talk much.\nSec. Gent.: I am confident; You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear A buzzing of a separation Between the king and Katharine?\nFirst Gent.: Yes, but it held not: For when the king once heard it, out of anger He sent command to the lord mayor straight To stop the rumour, and allay those tongues That durst disperse it.\nSec. Gent.: But that slander, sir, Is found a truth now: for it grows again Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal, Or some about him near, have, out of malice To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple That will undo her: to confirm this too, Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately; As all think, for this business.\nFirst Gent.: 'Tis the cardinal; And merely to revenge him on the emperor For not bestowing on him, at his asking, The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.\nSec. Gent.: I thinkyou have hit the mark: but is 't not cruel That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal Will have his will, and she must fall.\nFirst Gent.: 'Tis woful. We are too open here to argue this; Let's think in private more.Exeunt.",

She's a stranger now again.\nAnne.: So much the more Must pity drop upon her. Verily, I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born, And range with humble livers in content, Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief, And wear a golden sorrow.\nOld L.: Our content Is our best having.\nAnne.: By my troth and maidenhead, I would not be a queen.\nOld L.: Beshrew me, I would, And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you, For all this spice of your hypocrisy: You, that have so fair parts of woman on you, Have too a woman's heart: which ever yet Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty; Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts, Saving your mincing, the capacity Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive, If you might please to stretch it.\nAnne.: Nay, good troth.\nOld L.: Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?\nAnne.: No, not for all the riches under heaven.\nOld L.: 'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me, Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you, What think you of a duchess? have you limbs To bear that load of title?\nAnne.: No, in truth.\nOld L.: Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little; I would not be a young count in your way, For more than blushing comes to: if your back Cannot vouchsafe this burthen, 'tis too weak Ever to get a boy.\nAnne.: How you do talk! I swear again, I would not be a queen For all the world.\nOld L.: In faith, for little England You'ld venture an emballing: I myself Would for Carnarvonshire, although there 'long'd No more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN.\nCham.: Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know The secret of your conference?\nAnne.: My good lord, Not your demand; it values not your asking: Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.\nCham.: It was a gentle business, and becoming The action of good women: there is hope All will be well.\nAnne.: Now, I pray God, amen!\nCham.: You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady, Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty Commends his good opinion of you, and Does purpose honour to you no less flowing Than Marchioness of Pembroke; to which title A thousand pound a year, annual support, Out of his grace he adds.\nAnne.: I do not know What kind of my obedience I should tender; More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship, Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience, As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness; Whose health and royalty I pray for.\nCham.: Lady, I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit The king hath of you.[Aside] I have perused her well; Beauty and honour in her are so mingled That they have caught the king: and who knows yet But from this lady may proceed a gem To lighten all this isle?

I have been begging sixteen years in court, And yet a courtier beggarly, nor could Come pat betwixt too early and too late For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate! A very fresh fish here--fie, fie, fie upon This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up Before you open it.\nAnne.: This is strange to me.\nOld L.: How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no. There was a lady once, 'tis an old story, That would not be a queen, that would she not, For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?\nAnne.: Come, you are pleasant.\nOld L.: With your theme, I could O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke! A thousand pounds a year for pure respect! No other obligation! By my life, That promises moe thousands: honour's train Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time I know your back will bear a duchess: say, Are you not stronger than you were?\nAnne.: Good lady, Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy, And leave me out on 't. Would I had no being, If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me, To think what follows.

Kath.: Sir, I desire you do me right and justice; And to bestow your pity on me: for I am a most poor woman, and a stranger, Born out of your dominions; having here No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir, In what have I offended you? what cause Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure, That thus you should proceed to put me off, And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness, I have been to you a true and humble wife, At all times to your will conformable; Ever in fear to kindle your dislike, Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry As I saw it inclined: when was the hour I ever contradicted your desire, Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends Have I not strove to love, although I knew He were mine enemy? what friend of mine That had to him derived your anger, did I Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice He was from thence discharged? Sir, call to mind That I have been your wife, in this obedience, Upward of twenty years, and have been blest With many children by you: if, in the course And process of this time, you can report, And prove it too, against mine honour aught, My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty, Against your sacred person, in God's name, Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt Shut door upon me, and so give me up To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir, The king, your father, was reputed for A prince most prudent, of an excellent And unmatch'd wit and judgement: Ferdinand, My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many A year before: it is not to be question'd That they had gather'd a wise council to them Of every realm, that did debate this business, Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel I will implore: if not, i' the name of God, Your pleasure be fulfill'd!\nWol.: You have here, lady. And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men Of singular integrity and learning, Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless That longer you desire the court; as well For your own quiet, as to rectify What is unsettled in the king.\nCam.: His grace Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam, It's fit this royal session do proceed; And that, without delay, their arguments Be now produced and heard.\nQ. Kath.: Lord cardinal, To you I speak.\nWol.: Your pleasure, madam?\nQ. Kath.: Sir, I am about to weep; but, thinking that We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain The daughter of a king, my drops of tears I'll turn to sparks of fire.\nWol.: Be patient yet.\nQ. Kath.: I will, when you are humble; nay, before, Or God will punish me. I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances, that You are mine enemy, and make my challenge You shall not be my judge: for it is you Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me; Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again, I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more, I hold my most malicious foe, and think not At all a friend to truth.\nWol.: I do profess You speak not like yourself; who ever yet Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong: I have no spleen against you; nor injustice For you or any: how far I have proceeded, Or how far further shall, is warranted By a commission from the consistory, Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me That I have blown this coal: I do deny it: The king is present: if it be known to him That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound, And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much As you have done my truth. If he know That I am free of your report, he knows I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to Remove these thoughts from you: the which before His highness shall speak in, I do beseech You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking And to say so no more.\nQ. Kath.: My lord, my lord, I am a simple woman, much too weak To oppose your cunning. You're meek and humble-mouth'd; You sign your place and calling, in full seeming, With meekness and humility; but your heart Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride. You have, by fortune and his highness' favours, Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted Where powers are your retainers, and your words, Domestics to you, serve your will as't please Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you, You tender more your person's honour than Your high profession spiritual: that again I do refuse you for my judge; and here, Before you all, appeal unto the pope, To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness, And to be judged by him.She curtsies to the King, and offers to depart.\nCam.: The queen is obstinate, Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well. She's going away.\nKing.: Call her again.\nCrier.: Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.\nGrif.: Madam, you are call'd back.\nQ. Kath.: What need you note it? pray you, keep your way: When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help, They vex me past my patience! Pray you, pass on: I will not tarry; no, nor ever more Upon this business my appearance make In any of ther courts.Exeunt Queen, and her Attendants.\nKing.: Go thy ways, Kate: That man i' the world who shall report he has A better wife, let him in nought be trusted, For speaking false in that: thou art, alone, If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness, Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government, Obeying in commanding, and thy parts Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out, The queen of earthly queens: she 's noble born; And, like her true nobility, she has Carried herself towards me.\nWol.: Most gracious sir, In humblest manner I require your highness, That it shall please you to declare, in hearing Of all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound, There must I be unloosed, although not there At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I Did broach this business to your highness; or Laid any scruple in your way, which might Induce you to the question on 't? or ever Have to you, but with thanks to God for such A royal lady, spake one the least word that might Be to the prejudice of her present state, Or touch of her good person?\nKing.: My lord cardinal, I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour, I free you from 't. You are not to be taught That you have many enemies, that know not Why they are so, but, like to village-curs, Bark when their fellows do: by some of these The queen is put in anger. You're excused: But will you be more justified? you ever Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft, The passages made toward it: on my honour, I speak my good lord cardinal to this point, And thus far clear him.Now, what moved me to't, I will be bold with time and your attention: Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't: My conscience first received a tenderness, Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador; Who had been hither sent on the debating A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business, Ere a determinate resolution, he, I mean the bishop, did require a respite; Wherein he might the king his lord advertise Whether our daughter were legitimate, Respecting this our marriage with the dowager, Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me, Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble The region of my breast; which forced such way, That many mazed considerings did throng And press'd in with this caution. First, methought I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had Commanded nature, that my lady's womb, If it conceived a male child by me, should Do no more offices of life to 't than The grave does to the dead; for her male issue Or died where they were made, or shortly after This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought, This was a judgement on me; that my kingdom, Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer Toward this remedy, whereupon we are Now present here together; that's to say, I meant to rectify my conscience,--which I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,-- By all the reverend fathers of the land And doctors learn'd: first I began in private With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember How under my oppression I did reek, When I first moved you.\nLin.: Very well, my liege.\nKing.: I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say How far you satisfied me.\nLin.: So please your highness, The question did at first so stagger me, Bearing a state of mighty moment in't And consequence of dread, that I committed The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt; And did entreat your highness to this course Which you are running here.\nKing.: I then moved you, My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave To make this present summons: unsolicited I left no reverend person in this court; But by particular consent proceeded Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on; For no dislike i' the world against the person Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward: Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life And kingly dignity, we are contented To wear our mortal state to come with her, Katharine our queen, before the primest creature That's paragon'd o' the world.\nCam.: So please your highness, The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness That we adjourn this court till further day: Meanwhile must be an earnest motion Made to the queen, to call back her appeal She intends unto his holiness.\nKing.: [[Aside]] I may perceive These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome. My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer, Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know, My comfort comes along. Break up the court: I say, set on.[Exeunt in manner as they entered.",

What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?\nWol.: May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw Into your private chamber, we shall give you The full cause of our coming.\nQ.

My lords, I care not, so much I am happy Above a number, if my actions Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em, Envy and base opinion set against 'em, I know my life so even. If your business Seek me out, and that way I am wife in, Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.\nWol.: Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenissima,--\nQ. Kath.: O, good my lord, no Latin; I am not such a truant since my coming, As not to know the language I have lived in: A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious; Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you, If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake; Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal, The willing'st sin I ever yet committed May be absolved in English.\nWol.: Noble lady, I am sorry my integrity should breed, And service to his majesty and you, So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant. We come not by the way of accusation, To taint that honour every good tongue blesses, Nor to betray you any way to sorrow, You have too much, good lady; but to know How you stand minded in the weighty difference Between the king and you; and to deliver, Like free and honest men, our just opinions And comforts to your cause.\nCam.: Most honour'd madam, My lord of York, out of his noble nature, Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace, Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure Both of his truth and him, which was too far, Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace, His service and his counsel.\nQ. Kath.: [[Aside]] To betray me.-- My lords, I thank you both for your good wills; Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so! But how to make ye suddenly an answer, In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,-- More near my lfe, I fear,--with my weak wit, And to such men of gravity and learning, In truth, I know not. I was set at work Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking Either for such men or such business. For her sake that I have been,--for I feel The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces, Let me have time and counsel for my cause: Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!\nWol.: Madam,you wrong the king's love with these fears: Your hopes and friends are infinite.\nQ. Kath.: In England But little for my profit: can you think, lords, That any Englishman dare give me counsel? Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness pleasure, Though he be grown so desperate to be honest, And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends, They that must weigh out my afflictions, They that my trust must grow to, live not here: They are, as all my other comforts, far hence In mine own country, lords.\nCam.: I would your grace Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.\nQ. Kath.: How, sir?\nCam.: Put your main cause into the king's protection; He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much Both for your honour better and your cause; For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye, You'll part away disgraced.\nWol.: He tells you rightly.\nQ. Kath.: Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin: Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye! Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge That no king can corrupt.\nCam.: Your rage mistakes us.\nQ. Kath.: The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye, Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues; But cardinal sins and nollow hearts I fear ye: Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort? The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady, A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd? I will not wish ye half my miseries; I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye; Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.\nWol.: Madam, this is a mere distraction; You turn the good we offer into envy.\nQ. Kath.: Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye And all such false professors; would you have me-- If you have any justice, any pity; If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits-- Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me? Alas, has banish'd me his bed already, His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords, And all the fellowship I hold now with him Is only my obedience. What can happen To me above this wretchedness? all your studies Make me a curse like this.\nCam.: Your fears are worse.\nQ. Kath.: Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself, Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one? A woman, I dare say without vain-glory, Never yet branded with suspicion? Have I with all my full affections Still met the king? loved him next heaven? obey'd him? Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him? Almost forgot my prayers to content him? And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords. Bring me a constant woman to her husband, One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure; And to that woman, when she has done most, Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.\nWol.: Madam, you wander from the goodwe aim at.\nQ. Kath.: My lord,I dare not make myself so guilty, To give up willingly that noble title Your master wed me to: nothing but death Shall e'er divorce my dignities.\nWol.: Pray, hear me.\nQ. Kath.: Would I had never trod this English earth, Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it! Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts. What will become of me now, wretched lady! I am the most unhappy woman living. Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes! Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity, No friends, no hope; no kindred weep for me; Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily, That once was mistress of the field and flourished, I'll hang my head and perish.\nWol.: If your grace Could be brought to know our ends are honest, You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady, Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places, The way of our profession is against it: We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em. For goodness' sake, consider what you do; How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage. The hearts of princes kiss obedience, So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits They swell, and grow as terrible as storms. I know you have a gentle, noble temper, A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.\nCam.: Madam, you'll find it so.You wrong your virtues With these weak women's fears; a noble spirit, As yours was put into you, ever casts Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you; Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please To trust us in your business, we are ready To use our utmost studies in your service.\nQ. Kath.: Do what ye will, my lords:and, pray, forgive me, If I have used myself unmannerly; You know I am a woman, lacking wit To make a seemly answer to such persons. Pray, do my service to his majesty: He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers, Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs, That little thought, when she set footing here, She should have bought her dignities so dear.[Exeunt.",

Now, my lords, Saw you the cardinal?\nNor.: My lord, we have Stood here observing him; some strange commotion Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts; Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground, Then lays his finger on his temple; straight Springs out into fast gait; then stops again, Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts His eye against the moon: in most strange postures We have seen him set himself.\nKing.: It may well be; There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning Papers of state he sent me to peruse, As I required: and wot you what I found There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly? Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing; The several parcels of his plate, his treasure, Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks Possession of a subject.\nNor.: It's heaven's will: Some spirit put this paper in the packet, To bless your eye withal.\nKing.: If we did think His contemplation were above the earth, And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid His thinkings are below the moon, not worth His serious considering.King takes his seat; whispers Lowell, who goesto the Cardinal.\nWol.: Heaven forgive me! Ever God bless your highness!\nKing.: Good my lord, You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory Of your best graces in your mind; the which You were now running o'er: you have scarce time To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that I deem you an ill husband, and am glad To have you therein my companion.\nWol.: Sir, For holy offices I have a time; a time To think upon the part of business which I bear i' the state; and nature does require Her times of preservation, which perforce I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal, Must give my tendance to.\nKing.: You have said well.\nWol.: And ever may your highness yoke together, As I will lend you cause, my doing well With my well saying!\nKing.: 'Tis well said again; And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well: And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you: He said he did; and with his deed did crown His word upon you. Since I had my office, I have kept you next my heart, have not alone Employ'd you where high profits might come home, But pared my present havings, to bestow My bounties upon you.\nWol.: [[Aside]] What should this mean?\nSur.: [[Aside]] The Lord increase this business!\nKing.: Have I not made you The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me, If what I now pronounce you have found true: And, if you may confess it, say withal, If you are bound to us or no. What say you?\nWol.: My sovereign, I confess your royal graces, Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could My studied purposes requite; which went Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours Have ever come too short of my desires, Yet filled with my abilities: mine own ends Have been mine so that ever more they pointed To the good of your most sacred person and The profit of the state. For your great graces Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I Can nothing render but allegiant thanks, My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty, Which ever has and ever shall be growing, Till death, that winter, kill it.\nKing.: Fairly answer'd; A loyal and obedient subject is Therein illustrated: the honour of it Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary, The foulness is the punishment. I presume That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you, My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour more On you than any; so your hand and heart, Your brain, and every function of your power, Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty, As 'twere in love's particular, be more To me, your friend, than any.\nWol.: I do profess That for your highness' good I ever labour'd More than mine own; tthat am, have, and will be-- Though all the world should crack their duty to you, And throw it from their soul; though perils did Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty, As doth a rock against the chiding flood, Should the approach of this wild river break, And stand unshaken yours.\nKing.: 'Tis nobly spoken: Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast, For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;Giving him papers. And after, this: and then to breakfast with What appetite you have.Exit King, frowning upon Cardinal Wolsey: the noblesthrong after him, smiling and whispering.\nWol.: What should this mean? What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it? He parted frowning from me, as if ruin Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him; Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper; I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so; This paper has undone me: 'tis the account Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedome, And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence! Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil Made me put this main secret in the packet I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this? No new device to beat this from his brains? I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!' The letter, as I live, with all the business I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell! I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness; And, from that full meridian of my glory, I haste now to my setting: I shall fall Like a bright exhalation in the evening. And no man see me more.Re-enter to WOLSEY, the DUKES OF NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, theEARL OF SURREY, and the LORD CHAMBERLAIN.\nNor.: Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal:who commands you To render up the great seal presently Into our hands; and to confine yourself To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's, Till you hear further from his highness.\nWol.: Stay: Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry Authority so weighty.\nSuf.: Who dare cross 'em, Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?\nWol.: Till I find more than will or words to do it, I mean your malice, know, officious lords, I dare and must deny it. Now I feel Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy: How eagerly ye follow my disgraces, As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin! Follow your envious courses, men of malice; You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt, In time will find their fit rewards. That seal, You ask with such a violence, the king, Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me; Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours, During my life; and, to confirm his goodness, Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?\nSur.: The king, that gave it.\nWol.: It must be himself, then.\nSur.: Thou art a proud traitor, priest.\nWol.: Proud lord, thou liest: Within these forty hours Surrey durst better Have burnt that tongue than said so.\nSur.: Thy ambition, Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law: The heads of all thy brother cardinals, With thee and all thy best parts bound together, Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy! You sent me deputy for Ireland; Far from his succour, from the king, from all That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him; Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity, Absolved him with an axe.\nWol.: This, and all else This talking lord can lay upon my credit, I answer is most false. The duke by law Found his deserts: how innocent I was From any private malice in his end, His noble jury and foul cause can witness. If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you You have as little honesty as honour, That in the way of loyalty and truth Toward the king, my ever royal master, Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be, And all that love his follies.\nSur.: By my soul, Your long coat, priest, protects you;thou shouldst feel My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords, Can ye endure to hear this arrogance? And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely, To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet, Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward, And dare us with his cap like larks.\nWol.: All goodness Is poison to thy stomach.\nSur.: Yes, that goodness Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one, Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion; The goodness of your intercepted packets You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness, Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious. My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble, As you respect the common good, the state Of our despised nobility, our issues, Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen, Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles Collected from his life. I'll startle you Worse than the sacring bell, when the brown wench Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.\nWol.: How much, methinks, I could despise this man, But that I am bound in charity against it!\nNor.: Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand: But, thus much, they are foul ones.\nWol.: So much fairer And spotless shall mine innocence arise, When the king knows my truth.\nSur.: This cannot save you: I thank my memory, I yet remember Some of these articles; and out they shall. Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal, You'll show a little honesty.\nWol.: Speak on, sir; I dare your worst objections: if I blush, It is to see a nobleman want manners.\nSur.: I had rather want those than my head.Have at you! First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge, You wrought to be a legate; by which power You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.\nNor.: Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus' Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king To be your servant.\nSuf.: Then that, without the knowledge Either of king or council, when you went Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold To carry into Flanders the great seal.\nSur.: Item, you sent a large commission To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude, Without the king's will or the state's allowance, A league between his highness and Ferrara.\nSuf.: That, out of mere ambition, you have caused Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.\nSur.: Then that you have sent innumerable substance-- By what means got, I leave to your own conscience-- To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways You have for dignities: to the mere undoing Of all the kingdom. Many more there are; Which, since they are of you, and odious, I will not taint my mouth with.\nCham.: O my lord, Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue: His faults lie open to the laws; let them, Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him So little of his great self.\nSur.: I forgive him.\nSuf.: Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is, Because all those things you have done of late, By your power legatine, within this kingdom, Fall into the compass of a praemunire, That therefore such a writ be sued against you; To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements, Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.\nNor.: And so we'll leave you to your meditations How to live better. For your stubborn answer About the giving back the great seal to us, The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you. So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.Exeunt all but Wolsey.\nWol.: So farewell to the little good you bear me. Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness! This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms, And bears his blushing honours thick upon him; The third day comes a frost, a killing frost, And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root, And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured, Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders, This many summers in a sea of glory, But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride At length broke under me and now has left me, Weary and old with service, to the mercy Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me. Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye: I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretch'd Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours! There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to, That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin, More pangs and fears than wars or women have: And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer, Never to hope again.Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed. Why, how now, Cromwell!\nCrom.: I have no power to speak, sir.\nWol.: What, amazed At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep, I am fall'n indeed.\nCrom.: How does your grace?\nWol.: Why, well; Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell. I know myself now; and I feel within me A peace above all earthly dignities, A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me, I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders, These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken A load would sink a navy, too much honour: O, 'tis a burden, Cromwell, 'tis a burden Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!\nCrom.: I am glad your gracehas made that right use of it.\nWol.: I hope I have:I am able now, methinks, Out of a fortitude of soul I feel, To endure more miseries and greater far Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer. What news abroad?\nCrom.: The heaviest and the worst Is your displeasure with the king.\nWol.: God bless him!\nCrom.: The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen Lord chancellor in your place.\nWol.: That's somewhat sudden, But he's a learned man. May he continue Long in his highness' favour, and do justice For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones, When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings, May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on 'em! What more?\nCrom.: That Cranmer is return'd with welcome, Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.\nWol.: That's news indeed.\nCrom.: Last, that the Lady Anne, Whom the king hath in secrecy long married, This day was view'd in open as his queen, Going to chapel; and the voice is now Only about her coronation.\nWol.: There was the weight that pull'd me down.O Cromwell, The king has gone beyond me: all my glories In that one woman I have lost for ever: No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours, Or gild again the noble troops that waited Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell; I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now To be thy lord and master: seek the king; That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him What and how true thou art: he will advance thee; Some little memory of me will stir him-- I know his noble nature--not to let Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell, Neglect him not; make use now, and provide For thine own future safety.\nCrom.: O my lord, Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forgo So good, so noble and so true a master? Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron, With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord. The king shall have my service; but my prayers For ever and for ever shall be yours.\nWol.: Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me, Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman. Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell; And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be, And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee, Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory, And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour, Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in; A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it. Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me. Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition: By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then, The image of his Maker, hope to win by it? Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee; Corruption wins not more than honesty. Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace, To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not: Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's, Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell, Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king; And,--prithee, lead me in: There take an inventory of all I have, To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe, And my integrity to heaven, is all I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell! Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king, he would not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies.\nCrom.: Good sir, have patience.\nWol.: So I have. Farewell The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.[Exeunt.",

Gent.: So are you.\nFirst Gent.: You come to take your stand here, and behold The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?\nSec. Gent.: 'Tis all my business. At our last encounter, The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.\nFirst Gent.: 'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow; This, general joy.\nSec. Gent.: 'Tis well: the citizens, I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds-- As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward-- In celebration of this day with shows, Pageants and sights of honour.\nFirst Gent.: Never greater, Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.\nSec. Gent.: May I be bold to ask what that contains, That paper in your hand?\nFirst Gent.: Yes; 'tis the list Of those that claim their offices this day By custom of the coronation. The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk, He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.\nSec. Gent.: I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs, I should have been beholding to your paper. But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine, The princess dowager? how goes her business?\nFirst Gent.: That I can tell you too. The Archbishop Of Canterbury, accompanied with other Learned and reverend fathers of his order, Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which She was often cited by them, but appear'd not: And, to be short, for not appearance and The king's late scruple, by the main assent Of all these learned men she was divorced, And the late marriage made of none effect: Since which she was removed to Kimbolton, Where she remains now sick.\nSec. Gent.: Alas, good lady!Trumpets. The trumpets sound: stand close,the queen is coming.Hautboys.THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION.1. A lively flourish of Trumpets2. Then, two Judges.3. Lord Chancellor, with the purse and mace before him.4. Choristers, singing. [Music.5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then Garter, inhis coat of arms, and on his head a gilt coppercrown.6. Marquess DORSET, bearing a sceptre of gold, on his heada demi-coronal of gold. With him, the Earl of SURREY,bearing the rod of silver, with the dove, crowned with anearl's coronet. Collars of SS.7. Duke of SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet on hishead, bearing a long white wand, as high-steward. Withhim, the Duke of NORFOLK, with the rod of marshalship,a coronet on his head. Collars of SS.8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque- ports; under it,the Queen in her robe; in her hair richly adorned withpearl, crowned. On each side her, the Bishops of Londonand Winchester.9. The old Duchess of NORFOLK, in a coronal of gold,wrought with flowers, bearing the Queen's train.10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain circlets ofgold without flowers.They pass over the stage in order and state.\nSec. Gent.: A royal train, believe me. These I know: Who's that that bears the sceptre?\nFirst Gent.: Marquess Dorset: And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.\nSec. Gent.: A bold brave gentleman. That should be The Duke of Suffolk?\nFirst Gent.: 'Tis the same: high-steward.\nSec. Gent.: And that my Lord of Norfolk?\nFirst Gent.: Yes.\nSec. Gent.: Heaven bless thee![Looking on the Queen. Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on. Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel; Our king has all the Indies in his arms, And more and richer, when he strains that lady: I cannot blame his conscience.\nFirst Gent.: They that bear The cloth of honour over her, are four barons Of the Cinque-ports.\nSec. Gent.: Those men are happy; and so are all are near her. I take it, she that carries up the train Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.\nFirst Gent.: It is; and all the rest are countesses.\nSec. Gent.: Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed; And sometimes falling ones.\nFirst Gent.: No more of that.[Exit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpets.Enter a third Gentleman.\nFirst Gent.: God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?\nThird Gent.: Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled With the mere rankness of their joy.\nSec. Gent.: You saw The ceremony?\nThird Gent.: That I did.\nFirst Gent.: How was it?\nThird Gent.: Well worth seeing.\nSec. Gent.: Good sir, speak it to us.\nThird Gent.: As well as I am able. The rich stream Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen To a prepared place in the choir, fell off A distance from her; while her grace sat down To rest awhile, some half an hour or so, In a rich chair of state, opposing freely The beauty of her person to the people. Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman That ever lay by man: which when the people Had the full view, such a noise arose As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest, As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks,-- Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy I never saw before. Great-bellied women, That had not half a week to go, like rams In the old time of war, would shake the press, And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven So strangely in one piece.\nSec. Gent.: But, what follow'd?\nThird Gent.: At length her grace rose, and with modest paces Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly. Then rose again and bow'd her to the people: When by the Archbishop of Canterbury She had all the royal makings of a queen; As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown, The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir, With all the choicest music of the kingdom, Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted, And with the same full state paced back again To York-place, where the feast is held.\nFirst Gent.: Sir, You must no more call it York-place, that's past; For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost: 'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.\nThird Gent.: I know it; But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name Is fresh about me.\nSec. Gent.: What two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the queen?\nThird Gent.: Stokesly and Cardiner; the one of Winchester, Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary, The other, London.\nSec. Gent.: He of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's, The virtuous Cranmer.\nThird Gent.: All the land knows that: However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes, Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.\nSec. Gent.: Who may that be, I pray you?\nThird Gent.: Thomas Cromwell; A man in much esteem with the king, and truly A worthy friend. The king hath made him master O' the jewel house, And one, already, of the privy council.\nSec. Gent.: He will deserve more.\nThird Gent.: Yes, without all doubt. Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests: Something I can command. As I walk thither, I'll tell ye more.\nBoth.: You may command us, sir.[Exeunt.",

My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth, Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair: So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease. Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me, That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?\nGrif.: Yes, madam; but I think your grace, Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to 't.\nKath.: Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died: If well, he stepp'd before me, happily For my example.\nGrif.: Well, the voice goes, madam: For after the stout Earl Northumberland Arrested him at York, and brought him forward, As a man sorely tainted, to his answer, He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill He could not sit his mule.\nKath.: Alas, poor man!\nGrif.: At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester, Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend With all his covent, honourably received him; To whom he gave these words, 'O father abbot, An old man, broken with the storms of state, Is come to lay his weary bones among ye; Give him a little earth for charity!' So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness Pursued him still; and, three nights after this, About the hour of eight, which he himself Foretold should be his last, full of repentance, Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows, He gave his honours to the world again, His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.\nKath.: So may he rest;his faults lie gently on him! Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him, And yet with charity. He was a man Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking Himself with princes, one that, by suggestion, Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play; His own opinion was his law: i' the presence He would say untruths; and be ever double Both in his words and meaning: he was never, But where he meant to ruin, pitiful: His promises were, as he then was, mighty; But his performance, as he is now, nothing: Of his own body he was ill, and gave The clergy ill example.\nGrif.: Noble madam, Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues We write in water. May it please your highness To hear me speak his good now?\nKath.: Yes, good Griffith; I were malicious else.\nGrif.: This cardinal, Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle. He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one; Exceeding wise, fair-spoken and persuading: Lofty and sour to them that loved him not; But to those men that sought him sweet as summer. And though he were unsatisfied in getting, Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam, He was most princely: ever witness for him Those twins of learning that he raised in you, Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him, Unwilling to outlive the good that did it; The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous, So excellent in art, and still so rising, That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue. His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him; For then, and not till then, he felt himself, And found the blessedness of being little: And, to add greater honours to his age Than man could give him, he died fearing God.\nKath.: After my death I wish no other herald, No other speaker of my living actions, To keep mine honour from corruption, But such an honest chronicler as Griffith. Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me, With thy religious truth and modesty, Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him! Patience, be near me still; and set me lower: I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith, Cause the musicians play me that sad note I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating On that celestial harmony I go to.Sad and solemn music.\nGrif.: She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet, For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.The vision.Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six personages,clad in white robes, wearing on their heads garlands ofbays, and golden vizards on their faces; branches of baysor palm in their hands. They first congee unto her, thendance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold a sparegarland over her head; at which the other four make reverentcurtsies; then the two that held the garland deliverthe same to the other next two, who observe the same orderin their changes, and holding the garland over herhead: which done, they deliver the same garland to thelast two, who likewise observe the same order: at which,as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs ofrejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven: and so intheir dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them.The music continues.\nKath.: Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone, And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?\nGrif.: Madam, we are here.\nKath.: It is not you I call for: Saw ye none enter since I slept?\nGrif.: None, madam.\nKath.: No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun? They promised me eternal happiness; And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.\nGrif.: I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams Possess your fancy.\nKath.: Bid the music leave, They are harsh and heavy to me.Music ceases.\nPat.: Do you note How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden? How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks, And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!\nGrif.: She is going, wench: pray, pray.\nPat.: Heaven comfort her!Enter a Messenger.\nMess.: An't like your grace,--\nKath.: You are a saucy fellow: Deserve we no more reverence?\nGrif.: You are to blame, Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness, To use so rude behaviour; go to, kneel.\nMess.: I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon; My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying A gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.\nKath.: Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow Let me ne'er see again.Exeunt Griffith and Messenger.Re-enter GRIFFTH, with CAPUCIUS. If my sight fail not, You should be lord ambassador from the emperor, My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.\nCap.: Madam, the same; your servant.\nKath.: O, my lord, The times and titles now are alter'd strangely With me since first you knew me.But, I pray you, What is your pleasure with me?\nCap.: Noble lady, First, mine own service to your grace; the next, The king's request that I would visit you; Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me Sends you his princely commendations, And heartily entreats you take good comfort.\nKath.: O my good lord, that comfort comes too late; 'Tis like a pardon after execution: That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me; But now I am past all comforts here, but prayers. How does his highness?\nCap.: Madam, in good health.\nKath.: So may he ever do! and ever flourish, When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter, I caused you write, yet sent away?\nPat.: No, madam.Giving it to Katharine.\nKath.: Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver This to my lord the king.\nCap.: Most willingly, madam.\nKath.: In which I have commended to his goodness The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter: The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her! Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding,-- She is young, and of a noble modest nature, I hope she will deserve well,--and a little. To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him, Heaven knows how dearly.My next poor petition Is, that his noble grace would have some pity Upon my wretched women, that so long Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully: Of which there is not one, I dare avow, And now I should not lie, but will deserve, For virtue and true beauty of the soul, For honesty and decent carriage, A right good husband, let him be a noble: And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em. The last is, for my men; they are the poorest, But poverty could never draw 'em from me; That they may have their wages duly paid 'em, And something over to remember me by: If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life And able means, we had not parted thus. These are the whole contents: and, good my lord, By that you love the dearest in this world, As you wish Christian peace to souls departed, Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king To do me this last right.\nCap.: By heaven, I will, Or let me lose the fashion of a man!\nKath.: I thank you, honest lord. Remember me In all humility unto his highness: Say his long trouble now is passing Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him, For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell, My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience, You must not leave me yet: I must to bed; Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench, Let me be used with honour: strew me over With maiden flowers, that all the world may know I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me, Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me. I can no more.Exeunt, leading Katharine.",

It seems you are in haste: an if there be No great offence belongs to't, give your friend Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk, As they say spirits do, at midnight, have In them a wilder nature than the business That seeks dispatch by day.\nLov.: My lord, I love you; And durst commend a secret to your ear Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour, They say, in great extremity; and fear'd She'll with the labour end.\nGar.: The fruit she goes with I pray for heartily, that it may find Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas, I wish it grubb'd up now.\nLov.: Methinks I could Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does Deserve our better wishes.\nGar.: But, sir, sir, Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious; And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well, 'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me, Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she, Sleep in their graves.\nLov.: Now, sir, you speak of two The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell, Beside that of the jewel house, is made master O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir, Stands in lte gap and trade of moe preferments, With which the time will load him. The archbishop Is the king's hand and tongue'; and who dare speak One syllable against him?\nGar.: Yes, yes, Sir Thomas There are that dare; and I myself have ventured To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day, Sir, I may tell it you, I think I have Incensed the lords o' the council, that he is, For so I know he is, they know he is, A most arch heretic, a pestilence That does infect the land: with which they moved Have broken with the king; who hath so far Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded To-morrow morning to the council-board He be convented.

Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?\nLov.: I could not personally deliver to her What you commanded me, but by her woman I sent your message; who return'd her thanks In the greatest humbleness, and desired your highness Most heartily to pray for her.\nKing.: What say'st thou, ha? To pray for her? what, is she crying out?\nLov.: So said her woman; and that her sufferance made Almost each pang a death.\nKing.: Alas, good lady!\nSuf.: God safely quit her of her burthen, and With gentle travail, to the gladding of Your highness with an heir!\nKing.: 'Tis midnight, Charles; Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers remember The estate of my poor queen.

Come, you and I must walk a turn together; I have news to tell you:come, come, give me your hand. Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak, And am right sorry to repeat what follows: I have, and most unwillingly, of late Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord, Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd, Have moved us and our council, that you shall This morning come before us; where, I know, You cannot with such freedom purge yourself, But that, till further trial in those charges Which will require your answer, you must take Your patience to you, and be well contented To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us, It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness Would come against you.\nCran.: [[Kneeling]] I humbly thank your highness; And am right glad to catch this good occasion Most thoroughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know, There's none stands under more calumnious tongues Than I myself, poor man.\nKing.: Stand up, good Canterbury: Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted In us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up: Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame, What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd You would have given me your petition, that I should have ta'en some pains to bring together Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you, Without indurance, further.\nCran.: Most dread liege, The good I stand on is my truth and honesty: If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies, Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not, Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing What can be said against me.\nKing.: Know you not How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world? Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices Must bear the same proportion; and not ever The justice and the truth o' the question carries The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt To swear against you? such things have been done. You are potently opposed; and with a malice Of as great size. Ween you of better luck, I mean, in perjured witness, than your master, Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to; You take a precipice for no leap of danger, And woo your own destruction.\nCran.: God and your majesty Protect mine innocence, or I fall into The trap is laid for me!\nKing.: Be of good cheer; They shall no more prevail than we give way to. Keep comfort to you; and this morning see You do appear before them: if they shall chance, In charging you with matters, to commit you, The best persuasions to the contrary Fail not to use, and with what vehemency The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties Will render you no remedy, this ring Deliver them, and your appeal to us There make before them. Look, the good man weeps! He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest mother! I swear he is true-hearted; and a soul None better in my kingdom. Get you gone, And do as I have bid you.[Exit Cranmer.] He has strangled His language in his tears.Enter Old Lady, LOVELL following.\nGent.: [[Within]] Come back: what mean you?\nOld L.: I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person Under their blessed wings!\nKing.: Now, by thy looks I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd? Say, ay; and of a boy.\nOld L.: Ay, ay, my liege; And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl, Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen Desires your visitation, and to be Acquainted with this stranger: 'tis as like you As cherry is to cherry.\nKing.: Lovell!\nLov.: Sir?\nKing.: Give her an hundred marks.I'll to the queen.[Exit.\nOld L.: An hundred marks by this light, I'll ha' more. An ordinary groom is for such payment. I will have more, or scold it out of him. Said I for this, the girl was like to him?

If we suffer, Out of our easiness and childish pity To one man's honour, his contagious sickness, Farewell all physic: and what follows then? Commotions, uproars, with a general taint Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours, The upper Germany, can dearly witness, Yet freshly pitied in our memories.\nCran.: My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress Both of my life and office, I have labour'd, And with no little study, that my teaching And the strong course of my authority Might go one way, and safely; and the end Was ever, to do well: nor is there living, I speak it with a single heart, my lords, A man that more detests, more stirs against, Both in his private conscience and his place, Defacers of a public peace, than I do. Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart With less allegiance in it! Men that make Envy and crooked malice nourishment Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships, That, in this case of justice, my accusers, Be what they will, may stand forth face to face, And freely urge against me.\nSuf.: Nay, my lord, That cannot be: you are a counsellor, And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.\nGar.: My lord, because we have business of more moment, We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure, And our consent, for better trial of you, From hence you be committed to the Tower; Where, being but a private man again, You shall know many dare accuse you boldly, More than, I fear, you are provided for.\nCran.: Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you; You are always my good friend; if your will pass, I shall both find your lordship judge and juror, You are so merciful: I see your end; 'Tis my undoing; love and meekness, lord, Become a churchman better than ambition: Win straying souls with modesty again, Cast none away. That I shall clear myself, Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience, I make as little doubt, as you do conscience In doing daily wrongs. I could say more, But reverence to your calling makes me modest.\nGar.: My lord, my lord, you are a sectary, That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers, To men that understand you, words and weakness.\nCrom.: My Lord of Winchester, you are a little, By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble, However faulty, yet should find respect For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty To load a falling man.\nGar.: Good master secretary, I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst Of all this table, say so.\nCrom.: Why, my lord?\nGar.: Do not I know you for a favourer Of this new sect? ye are not sound.\nCrom.: Not sound?\nGar.: Not sound, I say.\nCrom.: Would you were half so honest! Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.\nGar.: I shall remember this bold language.\nCrom.: Do. Remember your bold life too.\nChan.: This is too much; Forbear, for shame, my lords.\nGar.: I have done.\nCrom.: And I.\nChan.: Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed, I take it, by all voices, that forthwith You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner; There to remain till the king's further pleasure Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?\nAll.: We are.\nCran.: Is there no other way of mercy, But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?\nGar.: What other Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.

Must I go like a traitor thither?\nGar.: Receive him, And see him safe i' the Tower.\nCran.: Stay, good my lords, I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords; By virtue of that ring, I take my cause Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it To a most noble judge, the king my master.\nCham.: This is the king's ring.\nSur.: 'Tis no counterfeit,\nSuf.: 'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all, When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling, 'Twould fall upon ourselves.\nNor.: Do you think, my lords, The king will suffer but the little finger Of this man to be vex'd?\nChan.: 'Tis now too certain: How much more is his life in value with him? Would I were fairly out on't!\nCrom.: My mind gave me, In seeking tales and informations Against this man, whose honesty the devil And his disciples only envy at, Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!Enter KING, frowning on them; takes his seat.\nGar.: Dread sovereign,how much are we bound to heaven In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince; Not only good and wise, but most religious: One that, in all obedience, makes the church The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen That holy duty, out of dear respect, His royal self in judgement comes to hear The cause betwixt her and this great offender.\nKing.: You were ever good at sudden commendations. Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not To hear such flattery now, and in my presence; They are too thin and bare to hide offences. To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel, And think with wagging of your tongue to win me; But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sure Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.[To Cranmer] Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee: By all that's holy, he had better starve Than but once think this place becomes thee not.\nSur.: May it please your grace,--\nKing.: No, sir, it does not please me. I had thought I had had men of some understanding And wisdom of my council; but I find none. Was it discretion, lords, to let this man, This good man,--few of you deserve that title,-- This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy At chamber-door? and one as great as you are? Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye Power as he was a counsellor to try him, Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see, More out of malice than integrity, Would try him to the utmost had ye mean; Which ye shall never have while I live.\nChan.: Thus far, My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed Concerning his imprisonment, was rather, If there be faith in men, meant for his trial, And fair purgation to the world, than malice, I'm sure, in me.\nKing.: Well, well, my lords, respect him; Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it, I will say thus much for him, if a prince May be beholding to a subject, I Am, for his love and service, so to him. Make me no more ado, but all embrace him: Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury, I have a suit which you must not deny me; That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism, You must be godfather, and answer for her.\nCran.: The greatest monarch now alive may glory In such an honour: how may I deserve it, That am a poor and humble subject to you?\nKing.: Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you, Embrace and love this man.\nGar.: With a true heart And brother-love I do it.\nCran.: And let heaven Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.\nKing.: Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart: The common voice, I see, is verified Of thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of Canterbury A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.' Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long To have this young one made a Christian. As I have made ye one, lords, one remain; So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.[Exeunt.",

Look, what will serve is fit; 'tis once, thou lovest, And I will fit thee with the remedy. I know we shall have revelling to-night: I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio, And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale: Then after to her father will I break; And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.

I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man: But nature never framed a woman's heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice; Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, Misprising what they look on, and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak: she cannot love, Nor take no shape nor project of affection, She is so self-endeared.\nUrs.: Sure, I think so; And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.\nHero.: Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man, How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured, But she would spell him backward: if fairfaced, She would swear the gentleman should be her sister; If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique, Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed; If low, an agate very vilely cut; If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds; If silent, why, a block moved with none. So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.\nUrs.: Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.\nHero.: No, not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable: But who dare tell her so? If I should speak, She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me Out of myself, press me to death with wit. Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire, Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly: It were a better death than die with mocks, Which is as bad as die with tickling.\nUrs.: Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.\nHero.: No; rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion. And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with: one doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking.\nUrs.: O, do not do your cousin such a wrong. She can not be so much without true judgement Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to haveas to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.\nHero.: He is the only man of Italy, Always excepted my dear Claudio.\nUrs.: I pray you, be not angry with me, madam, Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick, For shape, for bearing, argument and valor, Goes foremost in report through Italy.\nHero.: Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.\nUrs.: His excellence did earn it, ere he had it. When are you married, madam?\nHero.: Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in: I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.\nUrs.: She's limed, I warrant you:we have caught her, madam.\nHero.: If it proves so, then loving goes by haps: Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.[Exeunt Hero and Ursula.\nBeat.: [[Coming forward]] What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true? Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much? Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu! No glory lives behind the back of such. And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee, Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand: If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band; For others say thou dost deserve, and I Believe it better than reportingly.[Exit.",

Father, by your leave: Will you with free and unconstrained soul Give me this maid, your daughter?\nLeon.: As freely, son, as God did give her me.\nClaud.: And what have I to give you back, whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?\nD. Pedro.: Nothing, unless you render her again.\nClaud.: Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness. There, Leonato, take her back again: Give not this rotten orange to your friend; She's but the sign and semblance of her honor. Behold how like a maid she blushes here! O, what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal! Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear, All you that see her, that she were a maid, By these exterior shows? But she is none: She knows the heat of a luxurious bed; Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.\nLeon.: What do you mean, my lord?\nClaud.: Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.\nLeon.: Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof, Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth, And made defeat of her virginity,\nClaud.: I know what you would say: if I have known her, You will say she did embrace me as a husband, And so extenuate the 'forehand sin: No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large; But, as a brother to his sister, show'd Bashful sincerity and comely love.\nHero.: And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?\nClaud.: Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it: You seem to me as Dian in her orb, As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown; But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals That rage in savage sensuality.\nHero.: Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?\nLeon.: Sweet prince, why speak not you?\nD. Pedro.: What should I speak? I stand dishonor'd, that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale.\nLeon.: Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?\nD. John.: Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.\nBene.: This looks not like a nuptial.\nHero.: True! O God!\nClaud.: Leonato, stand I here? Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother? Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?\nLeon.: All this is so: but what of this, my lord?\nClaud.: Let me but move one question to your daughter; And, by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her, bid her answer truly.\nLeon.: I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.\nHero.: O, God defend me! how am I beset! What kind of catechising call you this?\nClaud.: To make you answer truly to your name.\nHero.: Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name With any just reproach?\nClaud.: Marry, that can Hero; Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue. What man was he talk'd with you yesternight Out at your window betwixt twelve and one? Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.\nHero.: I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.\nD. Pedro.: Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato, I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honor, Myself, my brother and this grieved count Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confess'd the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret.\nD. John.: Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord, Not to be spoke of; There is not chastity enough in language Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.\nClaud.: O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been, If half thy outward graces had been placed About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart! But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell, Thou pure impiety and impious purity! For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love, And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang, To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm, And never shall it more be gracious.\nLeon.: Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?[Hero swoons.\nBeat.: Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?\nD. John.: Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up.[Exeunt Don Pedro, Don John, and Claudio.\nBene.: How doth the lady?\nBeat.: Dead, I think. Help, uncle! Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!\nLeon.: O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand. Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wish'd for.\nBeat.: How now, cousin Hero!\nFriar.: Have comfort, lady.\nLeon.: Dost thou look up?\nFriar.: Yea, wherefore should she not?\nLeon.: Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood? Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes: For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die, Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames, Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches, Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one? Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame? O, one too much by thee! Why had I one? Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes? Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar's issue at my gates, Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy, I might have said 'No part of it is mine; This shame derives itself from unknown loins'? But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised And mine that I was proud on, mine so much That I myself was to myself not mine, Valuing of her,why, she, O, she is fallen Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again And salt too little which may season give To her foul-tainted flesh!\nBene.: Sir, sir, be patient. For my part, I am so attiredin wonder, I know not what to say,\nBeat.: O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!\nBene.: Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?\nBeat.: No, truly not; although, until last night, I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.\nLeon.: Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron! Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie, Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness, Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.\nFriar.: Hear me a little; for I have only been Silent solong and given way unto This course of fortune.... By notingof the lady I have mark'd A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes; And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire, To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool; Trust not my reading nor my observations, Which with experimental seal doth warrant The tenor of my book; trust not my age, My reverence, calling, nor divinity, If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here Under some biting error.\nLeon.: Friar, it cannot be. Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury; she not denies it: Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse That which appears in proper nakedness?\nFriar.: Lady, what man is he you are accused of?\nHero.: They know that do accuse me; I know none: If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant, Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father, Prove you that any man with me conversed At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight Maintain'd the change of words with any creature, Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!\nFriar.: There is some strange misprision in the princes.\nBene.: Two of them have the very bent of honor; And if their wisdoms be misled in this, The practice of it lives in John the bastard, Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.\nLeon.: I know not. If they speak but truth of her, These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honor, The proudest of them shall well hear of it. Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine, Nor age so eat up my invention, Nor fortune made such havoc of my means, Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends, But they shall find, awaked in such a kind, Both strength of limb and policy of mind, Ability in means and choice of friends, To quit me of them throughly.\nFriar.: Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case. Your daughter here the princes left for dead: Let her awhile be secretly kept in, And publish it that she is dead indeed; Maintain a mourning ostentation And on your family's old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial.\nLeon.: What shall become of this? what will this do?\nFriar.: Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf Change slander to remorse; that is some good: But not for that dream I on this strange course, But on this travail look for greater birth. She dying, as it must be so maintain'd, Upon the instant that she was accused, Shall be lamented, pitied and excused Of every hearer: for it so falls out That what we have we prize not to the worth Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost, Why, then we rack the value, then we find The virtue that possession would not show us Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio: When he shall hear she died upon his words, The idea of her life shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination, And every lovely organ of her life Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit, More moving-delicate and full of life, Into the eye and prospect of his soul, Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn, If ever love had interest in his liver, And wish he had not so accused her, No, though he thought his accusation true. Let this be so, and doubt not but success Will fashion the event in better shape Than I can lay it down in likelihood. But if all aim but this be levell'd false, The supposition of the lady's death Will quench the wonder of her infamy: And if it sort not well, you may conceal her, As best befits her wounded reputation, In some reclusive and religious life, Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.\nBene.: Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you: And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the prince and Claudio, Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body.\nLeon.: Being that I flow in grief, The smallest twine may lead me.\nFriar.: 'Tis well consented: presently away; For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure. Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.[Exeunt all but Benedick and Beatrice.",

Bring me a father that so loved his child, Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine, And bid him speak of patience; Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine And let it answer every strain for strain, As thus for thus and such a grief for such, In every lineament, branch, shape, and form: If such a one will smile and stroke his beard, Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan, Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me, And I of him will gather patience. But there is no such man: for, brother, men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it, Their counsel turns to passion, which before Would give preceptial medicine to rage, Fetter strong madness in a silken thread, Charm ache with air and agony with words: No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow, But no man's virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel: My griefs cry louder than advertisement.\nAnt.: Therein do men from children nothing differ.\nLeon.: I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood; For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance.\nAnt.: Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself; Make those that do offend you suffer too.\nLeon.: There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.

Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days, Do challenge thee to trial of a man. I say thou hast belied mine innocent child; Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart, And she lies buried with her ancestors; O, in a tomb where never scandal slept, Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!\nClaud.: My villany?\nLeon.: Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.\nD. Pedro.: You say not right, old man.\nLeon.: My lord, my lord, I'll prove it on his body, if he dare, Despite his nice fence and his active practice, His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.\nClaud.: Away! I will not have to do with you.\nLeon.: Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child: If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.\nAnt.: He shall kill two of us, and men indeed: But that's no matter; let him kill one first; Win me and wear me; let him answer me. Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me: Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence; Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.\nLeon.: Brother,\nAnt.: Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece; And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains, That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue: Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!\nLeon.: Brother Anthony,\nAnt.: Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea, And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple, Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys, That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander, Go anticly, show outward hideousness, And speak off half a dozen dangerous words, How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst; And this is all.\nLeon.: But, brother Anthony,\nAnt.: Come, 'tis no matter: Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.\nD.

I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death: Record it with your high and worthy deeds: 'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.\nClaud.: I know not how to pray your patience; Yet I must speak.

Pedro.: By my soul, nor I: And yet, to satisfy this good old man, I would bend under any heavy weight That he'll enjoin me to.\nLeon.: I cannot bid you bid my daughter live; That were impossible: but, I pray you both, Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died; and if your love Can labor ought in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night: To-morrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter, Almost the copy of my child that's dead, And she alone is heir to both of us: Give her the right you should have given heir cousin, And so dies my revenge.\nClaud.: O noble sir, Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me! I do embrace your offer; and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio.\nLeon.: To-morrow then I will expect your coming; To-night I take my leave. This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret, Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong, Hired to it by your brother.\nBora.: No, by my soul, she was not, Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me, But always hath been just and virtuous In any thing that I do know by her.\nLeon.: I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.\nLeon.: There's for thy pains.\nDog.: God save the foundation!\nLeon.: Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.\nAnt.: Farewell, my lords: we look for youto-morrow.\nD.

And when you loved, you were my other husband.\nClaud.: Another Hero!\nHero.: Nothing certainer: One Hero died defiled, but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid.\nD. Pedro.: The former Hero! Hero that is dead!\nLeon.: She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.\nFriar.: All this amazement can I qualify; When after that the holy rites are ended, I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death: Meantime let wonder seem familiar, And to the chapel let us presently.\nBene.: Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?\nBeat.: [[Unmasking]] I answer to that name. What is your will?\nBene.: Do not you love me?\nBeat.: Why, no; no more than reason.\nBene.: Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio Have been deceived; they swore you did.\nBeat.: Do not you love me?\nBene.: Troth, no; no more than reason.\nBeat.: Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.\nBene.: They swore that you were almost sick for me.\nBeat.: They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.\nBene.: 'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?\nBeat.: No, truly, but in friendly recompense.\nLeon.: Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.\nClaud.: And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her; For here's a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashion'd to Beatrice.\nHero.: And here's another Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick.\nBene.: Peace! I will stop your mouth.[Kissing her.\nLeon.: We'll have dancing afterward.\nMess.: My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight, And brought with armed men back to Messina.\nBene.: Think not on him till to-morrow: I'll devisethee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers.[Dance.[Exeunt.",
